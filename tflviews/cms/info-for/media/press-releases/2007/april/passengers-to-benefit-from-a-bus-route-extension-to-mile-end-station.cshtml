<p>Transport for London is pleased to announce the extension of route 205 to Mile End Station, and improvements to frequency from Saturday 28 April, 2007.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Route 205 currently runs between Paddington Station and Whitechapel Station.</p>
<p>The route will be extended from Whitechapel to Mile End Station via the Mile End Road and will run 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Transport for London will also be increasing the frequency of the service on weekday and Saturday daytimes by 33 per cent. </p>
<p>On Monday to Saturday, there will be a bus approximately every&nbsp;seven to&nbsp;eight minutes.</p>
<p>On Sundays, the frequency will remain as at present with a bus every 12 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new night service will run every 30 minutes. </p>
<p>The extended route will provide passengers with better links across East and West London and enhance services along the busy Mile End Road.</p>
<p>Route 205 provides links to many rail stations, including Liverpool Street, King's Cross, St Pancras, Euston, Marylebone and Paddington.</p>
<p>John Barry, Head of Network Development at London Buses said: 'Route 205 was introduced in 2002 and has been very successful.</p>
<p>'We are sure that this extension will be equally attractive to passengers on the new section between Whitechapel and Mile End.'</p>
