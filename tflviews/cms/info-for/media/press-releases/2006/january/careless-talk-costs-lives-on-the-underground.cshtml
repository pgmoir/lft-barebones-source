            <p>Platform for Art, London Underground's (LU's) public art programme is pleased to present a new exhibition, <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/corporate/projectsandschemes/artmusicdesign/pfa/artists/derbyshire.asp">Careless Talk Costs Lives</a>, by artist Beth Derbyshire. </p>

<p>Careless Talk Costs Lives represents military medals fused into decorative backgrounds based on the flora associated with war and remembrance. </p>
<p>The images feature Second World War propaganda slogans such as: 'careless talk costs lives', 'loose lips sink ships' and 'your words are weapons'. </p>
<p>The new exhibition invites the spectator to explore the imagery used in military iconography and propaganda. </p>
<p>Careless Talk Costs Lives evokes memories of Londoners' unity in the face of attack and the Underground network as a place of shelter during the raids.<br><br></p>
