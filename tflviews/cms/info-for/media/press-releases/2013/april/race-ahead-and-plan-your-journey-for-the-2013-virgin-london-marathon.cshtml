<p>This year's marathon is expected to be bigger than ever and travel advice is being offered at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/gettingaround/27600.aspx">tfl.gov.uk/marathon</a>. </p>
<p>The website will provide details on how transport services will run during London's largest annual running event. </p>
<p>Runners and spectators can also use TfL's social media channels to receive the latest information on marathon day at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/social-media">tfl.gov.uk/socialmedia</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Following the spectacular events of 2012 which saw the whole country unite in celebration, tens of thousands of people are set to take part in the 33rd Virgin London Marathon which will include world class athletes, celebrities and thousands of eager runners, raising millions of pounds for charities along the way. </p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to turn out to support the runners along the route, which will include some of the capital's most famous landmarks. </p>
<p>By planning in advance, spectators can choose the best places to watch the runners <a href="http://www.virginlondonmarathon.com/interactive-map/">www.virginlondonmarathon.com/interactive-map/</a>.</p>
<p>TfL's services will continue to keep the capital moving throughout the event. </p>
<p>The easiest way to travel to and from the race is by Tube, Bus, London Overground, Docklands Light Railway (DLR) or Riverboat, however, some stations and roads will be closed, so passengers are advised to plan their journeys in advance by using the dedicated website <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/marathon">tfl.gov.uk/marathon</a> or by contacting the 24 hour London Travel Information line on 0343 222 1234. </p>
<p>Motorists are also advised to check the website before they travel as there will be a number of road closures in south and central London. </p>
<p>Due to road closures and the demand on public transport, passengers are encouraged to consider walking as part of their journey to and from the marathon. </p>
<p>There will be free travel on the Tube, Bus, London Overground, Tram and DLR for all runners, race officials and on-duty St John Ambulance volunteers from early morning until 17:00, just by showing their race number, officials' course pass, or tabard. </p>
