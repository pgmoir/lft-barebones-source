<p>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) will this weekend carry out the final stage of physical works necessary to ensure the ORN in London is ready to begin operation on Wednesday 25 July - just two days before the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games - to get all athletes, officials and the world's media to their events on time.</p>
<p>As the Capital completes its transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue, and with just one week to go until the London 2012 Games begin, the athletes, officials and world's media are arriving in London in increasing numbers and final preparations are under way.</p>
<p>From 21:00 on Friday 20 July, the last of the preparatory works will take place on the road network, lasting five nights.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To keep disruption to a minimum, the majority of work will take place overnight.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The works will progressively change London's road network so that, by the morning of Monday 23 July, London's road network will look and feel different, but enforcement of the Games lanes and the official switch on of the ORN will not be until 06:00 on Wednesday 25 July.</p>
<p>TfL is urging motorists to check out a special film, explaining how the ORN, including the Games lanes, works and will be enforced at <a href="http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/things-you-should-know/olympic-route-network.html">www.GetAheadoftheGames.com/things-you-should-know/olympic-route-network.html</a></p>
<p>Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'The Olympic Route Network is a requirement of all host cities and is vital in ensuring athletes, officials and the world's media get to their events on time. </p>
<p>'Its length was slashed by one third of what had been planned and we're working hard to introduce changes to the road network as late as possible, to minimise the impact on Londoners and businesses.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'But with the Games just over a week away, we're into the home straight and are working flat out to ensure we are ready to welcome the world.'</p>

<h2>London's transformation</h2>
<p>Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing Director for Surface Transport, said: 'London's transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue is almost complete.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'From this weekend we'll be carrying out the final physical works to ensure the ORN, including the Games lanes, is ready to be in operation and enforced from Wednesday 25 July.</p>
<p>'London's roads are now exceptionally busy and we are working hard to support a great Games and keep London moving.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'From next week and during the Games, roads around the Olympic Route Network will operate differently.</p>
<p>'Our advice to road users is clear - don't get caught out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Avoid driving in central London, around the ORN and Games venues.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'If a journey by road is absolutely essential, plan ahead at <a href="http://www.GetAheadoftheGames.com">www.GetAheadoftheGames.com</a> and allow extra time.'</p>
<p>The final stage of works over the weekend, which will be carried out by up to 2,000 contractors, include installing barriers for the restricted turns and simplifying junctions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The physical changes to the road network along the ORN will keep traffic flowing along the route where, in additional to any non-Games traffic, there will be 1,300 vehicles an hour carrying the athletes, officials and world's media to their events on time.</p>
<p>Work to install three temporary pedestrian footbridges at Hyde Park Corner will also take place from Friday.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>Overnight works</h2>
<p>Most work will be overnight and will include short closures of parts of Hyde Park Corner and interim diversions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The bridges will help crowds get to and from the numerous Olympic and cultural events in the area, including the Olympic venues in Hyde Park, The Mall and Horse Guards Parade and the BT London Live site in Hyde Park. </p>
<p>They will be situated between Grosvenor Crescent and the Wellington Arch island and Green Park.</p>
<p>Work to prepare the ORN in London began at the start of July with the painting of Games lanes road markings and adjustments to 1,300 sets of traffic signals.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Overnight on Tuesday 24 July, designated pedestrian crossings will be suspended and parking and loading bays along the route will be removed.</p>
<p>The ORN is a requirement of the Host City contract and is vital in ensuring all athletes, officials and the world's media get to their London 2012 Games events on time. </p>

<p>The ORN covers 109 miles in total in London although Games lanes will only be used on 30 miles of the network. </p>

<p>They will operate alongside lanes for general traffic and will be reserved for the use of the athletes, coaches, technical officials and the world's media. </p>

<p>The Games lanes will generally operate between 06:00&nbsp;and midnight.</p>

<h2>Open for business</h2>
<p>Around 150 Variable Message Signs (VMS) have been placed along the ORN and clearly state to drivers that they may continue to use the road network as normal and are not restricted from using the Games lanes, with the exception of the M4 Games lane, until operation of the ORN begins next week.</p>
<p>Compliance on the ORN is key to ensuring that the Games run smoothly and London keeps moving. </p>

<p>A penalty charge of &pound;130 will be issued to owners of vehicles who break the regulations in London, including driving in Games lanes or stopping along the route and any illegally parked vehicle will be removed to a vehicle pound and may incur a release fee of &pound;200.</p>
<p>In order to ensure that the Capital remains open for business and we can keep London moving prior to and during the Games, TfL's advice to road users is clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motorists should now avoid driving in central London, around the ORN and Games venues until after the Games</li>
<li>Motorists should also avoid the areas around the road event courses on competition days such as the Cycling Road Races on 28 and 29 July, the Cycle Time Trial on 1 August and the Women's and Men's Marathons on 5 and 12 August</li>
<li>Every day of the Games is different, so if you must drive, plan ahead and allow more time</li>

<li></li></ul></strong>Map by map details of the Olympic and Paralympic Route Networks, including details of all traffic measures such as junctions changes and suspended pedestrian crossings can be found at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/orn">tfl.gov.uk/orn</a>
<li>All motorists can use the ORN, and only the 30 miles of Games lanes, alongside lanes for general traffic, will be reserved for vehicles carrying athletes, coaches, officials, media and some sponsors</li>
<li>TfL is committed to keeping London moving throughout the Games and will operate the Games lanes as flexibly as possible. They will be opened up to all traffic at times when demand from Games family vehicles is low and capacity available. A network of around 150 VMSs along the route will advise motorists when Games lanes are open to regular traffic throughout the day</li>
<li>The ORN will come into operation on 25 July, a couple of days before the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games. It will end operation a couple of days after the Games and will not be in operation between the Olympics and Paralympics. The smaller Paralympic Route Network (PRN) will also come into operation just a couple of days before the Paralympic Games. Once Games events are completed at a venue, such as Wimbledon, the ORN will be removed</li>
<li>The ORN also extends out of London to other London 2012 venues in England. These routes are being delivered by the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) in partnership with the respective local highway authorities. ORN operational and enforcement dates and times outside of London differ from those being delivered by TfL within London.

<li>To install the temporary bridges at Hyde Park the following diversions will take place:</li>
<ul>
<li>Friday 20 July: Grosvenor Place pedestrian subway will close</li>
<li>Sunday 22 July: Grosvenor Crescent will close in both directions, with local access via Belgrave Square. The eastbound lane of Grosvenor Crescent will remain closed until 16 August. Lanes will also be restricted both west and east of Hyde Park Corner. Overnight road closures for around one hour will take place on the west side of Hyde Park Corner and temporary diversions will be put in place. </li>
<li>Monday 23 July: from 21:00 lanes will be restricted around the east side of Hyde Park Corner into the early morning. Overnight road closures for around one hour will take place on the east side and temporary diversions will be in place</li></ul>
