        London Underground (LU) this evening advised passengers using the Northern line that the service is running with severe delays.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>A special service is running on the Northern line this evening: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Morden to High Barnet via Bank</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Kennington to Edgware via Charing Cross</strong></li></ul>
<p>The delays are due to the earlier suspension of the northbound Charing Cross branch of the Northern line between Kennington and Camden Town because of four signal failures. </p>
<p>The signal failures occurred in the Leicester Square area at midday and engineers worked through the afternoon to fix the problems in a deep section of the tunnel. </p>
<p>The repair work is being undertaken by Tube Lines. </p>
<p>London Underground tickets are being accepted on London Buses and train operating companies.<br></p>
