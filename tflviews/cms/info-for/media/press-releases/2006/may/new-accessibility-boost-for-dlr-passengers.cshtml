            <p> <!-- #EndEditable -->The on-train Audio and Visual Information System (AVIS) has been funded by Transport for London (TfL) as part of its commitment to improving accessibility on London's transport network.</p>
<p>AVIS provides information on train destinations, next stations and interchange opportunities throughout the journey of a train, using verbal announcements and scrolling display screens.</p>
<p>The system is designed to assist passengers with hearing or eyesight difficulties, as well as occasional users who may be unfamiliar with the DLR network.</p>
<p>Jonathan Fox, Director DLR, said: 'AVIS will improve the journey experience for our passengers by providing key information in a way that is convenient and easy to understand.  </p>
<p>'The DLR prides itself on being one of the most accessible modes of transport in the UK, reflected in rapidly increasing journey numbers and record customer satisfaction levels.'</p>
<p>Unlike any other railway in the UK, the DLR already offers full step-free access to all stations and trains for passengers with mobility impairments.  </p>
<p>The installation of the AVIS information system means that it is now also accessible for passengers with hearing or eyesight impairments.</p>
<p>As well as its accessibility benefits, AVIS will improve the quality of DLR customer information for all passengers.  </p>
<p>Research into passenger requirements has shown that tourists and occasional DLR users in particular feel that access to real-time information is very important.  </p>
<p> </p>
            <ul>
<li>The DLR is part of TfL.</li>
<li>The roll-out of the Audio and Visual Information System (AVIS) was concluded this month, after being fitted to the entire fleet of 94 trains</li>
<li>Over 50 million journeys are made on the DLR annually, a figure forecast to increase to 80 million by 2009. </li></ul>
