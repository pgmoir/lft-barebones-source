        Train passengers, particularly those with restricted mobility, will find their journeys from London Overground's West Croydon station made easier when a new gateline offering a direct link to adjacent tram and bus stops opens.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Transport for London's (TfL) Chief Operating Officer for Rail, Howard Smith, said: 'The new gateline will create a new station entrance for all passengers and make their interchange from bus and tram to rail much more convenient.'&nbsp; </p>
<p>Work on the new gateline which begins on Tuesday 10 April and is scheduled to last for eight weeks, will provide a more direct walking route from the West Croydon tram stop and bus station on Station Street to West Croydon London Overground station.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A wider gate in the new gateline will allow customers who use wheelchairs, or travel with a guide dog, buggy or large luggage to use the entrance which offers step-free access to Platform 4 without staff assistance. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Notes to Editors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, the entrance can only be used by mobility-impaired passengers and they must contact station staff through an intercom for the gate to be unlocked</li>
<li>During the work step-free access will be maintained through an alternative temporary entrance<br></li></ul>
