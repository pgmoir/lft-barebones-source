        Improved ticketing facilities opened at Victoria Underground station this week as part of the station's upgrade works.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>A completely refurbished ticket office providing five large ticket issuing windows re-opened in the Victoria line ticket hall. </p>
<p>Next to the ticket office there will be five new ticket machines. They are in addition to three new machines recently installed between the staircases leading to the mainline station. </p>
<h2>Cope with demand</h2>
<p>Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's transport advisor, said: 'With a whopping 80 million passengers using Victoria Underground every year upgrading its ticketing facilities is key to ensuring the station can cope with future demand and improve access for everyone that uses it. </p>
<p>'This is a significant step in what will eventually be a huge transformation of one of the Capital's key stations.'</p>
<p>John Doyle, the Victoria line Manager, said: 'The new ticketing facilities will reduce journey times by allowing customers to complete their purchases with minimal delay.</p>
<p>'Passengers will be able to buy the full range of Underground tickets using cash or cards. </p>
<h2>Investing in transport</h2>
<p>'The funding is in place for the station's main upgrade work beginning next summer which is part of TfL's Investment Programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'The station will be made step-free and much larger with a total of three ticket halls and an additional new entrance near Cardinal Place Shopping Mall. The work will be completed by 2018.'</p>

<strong>Notes to editors:</strong> 
<ul>
<li>In addition to the refurbished ticket office in the Victoria line ticket hall there is a ticket office in the District and Circle line ticket hall </li>
<li>London Underground (LU) is undertaking a major programme of renewal as part of Transport for London's Investment Programme.&nbsp;This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options.&nbsp;The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future. TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and DLR passengers to "check before you travel" at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.
