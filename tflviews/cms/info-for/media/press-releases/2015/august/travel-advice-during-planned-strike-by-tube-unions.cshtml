        If strike action goes ahead customers are advised to complete their journey by 18:30 on Wednesday 5 August

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Transport for London (TfL) has today outlined the measures it will put in place to help keep London moving in the event that planned industrial action on the Tube takes place.</p>
<p>Union leaders are currently planning a co-ordinated period of strike action starting on Wednesday 5 August for 24-hours. Customers are advised to complete their journeys by 18:30 on Wednesday afternoon and to travel earlier if possible, Tube services are expected to be exceptionally busy between 16:30 and 18:30.</p>
<p>Customers who are able to change their travel time are strongly advised to travel outside peak hours on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday, and all customers are advised to allow more time for their journeys. There will be no Tube services at all on Thursday.</p>
<p>Staff on the DLR, London Overground, the bus network, tram and TfL Rail services are not on strike. These services will run as normal, but they will be much busier than usual and customers are strongly advised to, if possible, travel outside of the morning and evening peaks.</p>
<p>Many locations in central London are easily accessible from mainline rail stations, and TfL will have staff on hand to help people get to their destinations on foot, by bus, by Santander Cycles or by other means.  Around 250 extra buses are being provided to boost capacity on the main commuter corridors and to and from mainline stations and additional Santander Cycles hubs will mean more bikes will be available at the busiest locations. Extra river services are also being provided. But in both cases, these will be very busy and customers are asked to bear with the transport staff who are at work and trying to help them get around.</p>
<p>Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: `Our customers are advised to check the TfL website for the latest information as we seek to resolve the dispute and to keep London moving should the unions go ahead with their action.</p>
<p>`On Friday we provided a revised offer, which we believe addresses all of the unions' concerns, rewards our hardworking staff and remains sustainable and affordable. We are now asking the unions to call off the planned strike action and put this very fair offer to their members.'</p>
<p>Travel advice to customers during the strike action:</p>
<p>Tube</p>
<ul>
    <li>The strike action that has been called involves Tube station staff and Tube drivers.</li>

    <li>There will be no Tube services at all on Thursday 6 August and all other public transport services and roads will be much busier than usual.</li>
    <li>Customers who are able to change their travel time are strongly advised to travel outside peak hours on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday.  All customers are advised to allow more time for their journeys.</li>
    <li>There will be a normal service on Friday 7 August.</li>

<p>Notes to Editors</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Night Tube is part of London Underground's work to modernise the service offered to customers.</li>
    <li>It is widely supported by Londoners and businesses and will transform night time journeys across London.</li>
    <li>Journey times will be cut by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour.</li>
    <li>London's night-time economy will be opened up to a host of new opportunities, with the Night Tube supporting around 2,000 permanent jobs and boosting the economy by &pound;360 million</li>
