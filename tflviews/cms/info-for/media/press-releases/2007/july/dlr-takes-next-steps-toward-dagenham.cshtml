<p>More than&nbsp;60,000 leaflets have been distributed to local residents, organisations and groups to seek opinion on route options. </p>
<p>Information will also be provided on the results of the first consultation phase, which indicated that 95&nbsp;per cent&nbsp;of respondents are in favour of the extension.</p>
<p>The proposed connection, which could open in 2016, would extend east from the existing DLR network at Gallions Reach with possible new stations at Beckton Riverside, Creekmouth, Barking Riverside, Dagenham Vale and Dagenham Dock. </p>
<h2>Favourable response</h2>
<p>Richard de Cani, DLR Head of Planning and Development, said: "We received a tremendously favourable response to our first round of consultation and it is clear there is significant local support for our proposed extension.</p>

<p>"I would urge recipients to read and respond to our latest leaflet as DLR is committed to two-way consultation and now is the time for interested parties to help shape the development of the project."</p>
<h2>Further consultation</h2>
<p>Further consultation will take place at the following public exhibitions:</p>
<ul>
<li>9 July, Castle Green, Gale Street, Dagenham </li>
<li>10 July, St Marks Community Centre, Tollgate Road, Beckton </li>
<li>11 July, CEME Campus, Marsh Way, Rainham </li></ul>
<p>All leaflet respondents will be entered into a prize draw where they have the chance to win &pound;250 of holiday vouchers from Thomas Cook. </p>
<p>The winner of the prize draw for the first consultation phase was Maureen Morgan of Dagenham.</p>

<li>The surrounding area is set to benefit from a wide-ranging housing and business regeneration programme over the next few years as &nbsp;part of the Government's Thames Gateway initiative </li>
<li>DLR's most recent extensions, to London City Airport in 2005 and Lewisham in 1999, have assisted local regeneration and &nbsp;improved accessibility for residents to jobs and other services. The lines opened ahead of schedule and on budget and passenger &nbsp;numbers continue to grow steadily on both </li>
