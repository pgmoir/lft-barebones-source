<li>Games Lanes will operate flexibly and remain open to all traffic if demand from vehicles carrying athletes officials and media is low and journey time reliability targets are being met </li>
<li>Motorists advised to avoid central London, around the ORN, venues and route of the Torch Relay </li>
<li>For the latest Games travel and advice visit <a href="http://www.getaheadofthegames.com/">GetAheadoftheGames.com</a> and follow &#64;GAOTG on Twitter </li>
<li>For the latest on how transport services are operating, check before you travel at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/">tfl.gov.uk</a> and follow &#64;TfLTravelAlerts (Tube, Docklands Light Railway [DLR] and London Overground) and &#64;TfLTrafficNews (roads) on Twitter</li></ul>
<p>From today, Transport for London&nbsp;(TfL) will issue twice daily media travel bulletins at around 7:00 and 14:00, setting out the latest London 2012 Games travel information and advice.</p>
<p>The Olympic Torch Relay continues its journey around London as the Capital's transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue is almost complete.&nbsp; </p>
<p>With just two days to go to the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games, it is time to put Games-time travel plans into action.</p>
<p>Central London, the ORN, areas around venues and the Torch Relay will be exceptionally busy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Up to one million extra visitors are expected in London every day during the Games, making an additional three million journeys over and above the usual 12 million daily journeys on public transport.</p>
<h2>TfL's key ORN advice for today:</h2>
<ul>
<li>From today, the ORN is in operation and being enforced along its 109-mile route in London from 6:00 to midnight </li>
<li>There is no stopping or loading along the entire length of the ORN in London and some routes, including Whitehall, Birdcage Walk and Constitution Hill are closed to general traffic </li>
<li>However, the ORN Games Lanes on all other routes will operate flexibly and will remain open to general traffic if the number of vehicles carrying athletes, officials and the world's media are low and journey time reliability targets are being met.&nbsp;Motorists should check the roadside electronic Variable Message Signs which will clearly state whether the Games Lanes are being enforced or not using one of the following two messages 
<ul>
<li>Games Lanes&nbsp;open to general traffic: 'All traffic use Games Lane' </li>
<li>Games Lanes closed to general traffic: 'Games Lane now Games Vehicles only'</li></ul></li>
<li>Physical changes to the road network have been carried out to London's road network and the ORN, including changes to junctions and banned turns.&nbsp;As a result, journey times on key routes into and around central London, the ORN and venues will take longer then usual </li>
<li>The A2, A3, A12, A13 and A40 will continue to be exceptionally busy, particularly in the morning rush hour </li>
<li>TfL's advice to motorists is clear. Avoid central London, around the ORN, venues and the route of the Torch Relay.&nbsp;If you have to drive, plan ahead, consider re-timing your journey and allow more time</li></ul>
<h2>TfL's key travel advice for today:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Londoners are turning out in very large and enthusiastic crowds to welcome the Torch as it travels through the Capital </li>
<li>If you are planning to view the Torch, stay local - the Torch is passing through every London borough so try to view it when it passes through an area close to your home or work </li>
<li>On public transport, avoid stations that are on or close to the Torch Relay routes.&nbsp;These stations will be exceptionally busy up to two hours before and at least one hour after the Torch passes </li>
<li>Cultural events are taking place across London today, see <a href="http://www.molpresents.com/">http://www.molpresents.com/</a> for further information. If possible, avoid these areas if you are not attending an event </li>
