        <p>Transport
        for London (TfL) has begun work to improve the busy junction at Malden Rushett
        village as part of its continuing programme of road modernisation.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        work, which began on Monday 22 September and lasts until Spring 2015, will
        improve road safety and traffic flow at the junction of the A243 Leatherhead
        Road, B280 Fairoak Lane and Rushett Lane. </p>
        <p>New right turn traffic signals and wider roads
        at Rushett Lane and Fairoak Lane will be delivered as part of the scheme, as
        well as new direct crossings for pedestrians and advance stop lines for
        cyclists. Once completed, the works are also expected to improve traffic
        conditions during the summer, when Chessington World of Adventures Resort is at
        its busiest
        &nbsp;
        In
        order to deliver the scheme, the works will be done in phases to reduce
        disruption. TfL will work to ensure that the junction will remain open for the
        majority of time, reducing the impact the works will have along the main road
        corridor, but some off-peak and night-time traffic lane closures will be
        required as the scheme progresses.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        A243 Leatherhead Road will also remain open throughout the works and access to
        residential addresses and businesses will not be affected, although there is
        expected to be increased traffic in the area which TfL will work to mitigate
        through traffic management.
        &nbsp;
        As
        part of the work, the B280 at Fairoak Lane and Rushett Lane will need to close
        alternately at times to enable improvement works to take place. Temporary
        traffic lights will be used during the closures and any diversion routes will
        be clearly signed.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        design process has also identified that, due to the poor condition of the
        current road surface of the B280 Fairoak Lane, the road needs to be
        reconstructed as part of these major works. In collaboration with the Royal
        Borough of Kingston upon Thames, these works have now been incorporated into
        the major scheme.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Alan Bristow, Director of
        Road Space Management at TfL, said: </p>
        <p>&quot;This junction in Malden Rushett village is
        important for businesses and commuters as well as visitors to Chessington World
        of Adventures. Therefore, it is important that we ensure that this junction
        stays safe and also keeps traffic flowing.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>`We are committed to
        completing these works as quickly and efficiently as possible and will keep the
        local community and road users informed of progress as we work to deliver these
        vital improvements.'
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>During the next ten years, TfL will be
        investing around &pound;4 billion into the capital's road network as part of the Mayor's
        Roads Task Force. Working with its partners, including London's boroughs and
        road user and street user groups, TfL will build on the improvements already
        seen in the management of London's roads, streets and public spaces to help
        ensure the capital remains one of the most attractive, vibrant, accessible and
        competitive cities in the world.
        &nbsp;

        <p>Notes
        to editors
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>TfL has worked
            closely with the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and Surrey County
            Council to ensure any disruption is kept to a minimum.
            &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>Preliminary works have been taking place for the
            last few months to prepare the worksite including better drainage systems
            installed and temporary traffic lights being put in place. Ahead of the
            main works, an environmental study has also been undertaken to identify
            potential impacts to the local area. Clearance of vegetation will be kept
            to a minimum and any hedgerow boundaries affected by the works will be
            replaced once the works are completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>London's roads account for 80 per cent of all
            journeys and 90 per cent of all goods moved in the capital. As the engine
            of the British economy, London's population is set to grow by almost 2
            million to 10 million by 2031 &#45; equivalent to absorbing the population of
            both Birmingham and Leeds.</li>
            <li>This
            is a continual challenge in a city with a road network that developed
            organically and was never designed for so much traffic. To meet the challenge,
            the Mayor and TfL are investing more than &pound;4 billion in improving London's
            roads, streets and urban realm for all road users, residents and businesses
            during the next decade.
            &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>To help deliver this wider programme of work, TfL
            has already begun to expand its innovative SCOOT technology, which can
            change traffic signal timings based on traffic levels second by second,
            from half of all signals to three quarters of all signals. Hundreds of
            staff are already working 24/7 to monitor the network. They will
            use&nbsp;London's intelligent traffic light technology to help traffic
            movement around these planned bridge closures in west London this summer,
            as well as keeping road users up-to-date on traffic conditions.&nbsp;</li>
