<p>The change from Tube to bus is to allow for construction work of the Piccadilly line extension to the new BAA Heathrow Terminal 5.  </p>
<p>Passengers should allow an extra 15 minutes for their journey time.   </p>
<p>The replacement bus services will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bus Service A: Hatton Cross - Heathrow Terminals 1,2 & 3 (non-stop)</li>
<li>Bus Service B: Hatton Cross - Heathrow Terminal 4 (non-stop)</li></ul>
<p>Passengers travelling from Hatton Cross will also be able to travel free on local buses. Porters will be provided at Hatton Cross and Heathrow Terminal 2 to help passengers load and unload their luggage on the bus and coach services.<br> <br>Mike Challis, Piccadilly line General Manager, said:"On Sunday 5 November all Piccadilly line trains will terminate at Hatton Cross to allow essential construction work to be carried out for the extension of the Piccadilly line to Terminal 5.  </p>
<p>"Passengers travelling to and from Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 & 3 and Heathrow Terminal 4 will have to take a non-stop replacement bus service connecting Heathrow with Hatton Cross. Leaflets detailing the changes are now available at stations."</p>
<p>Any passengers travelling to and from Terminal 4 who may have difficulty using the stairs at Hatton Cross should travel to Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 & 3 and use the Heathrow Express Service to reach Terminal 4, which is free between Heathrow terminals. </p>
<p>Passengers using this route should allow an extra 30 minutes to complete their journey.<br><br></p>
