            <p>The new routes replace the N50, which currently runs between Trafalgar Square and Gallions Reach Shopping Park in Beckton. </p>
<p>Route N50 will be withdrawn from Saturday 30 August.</p>
<p>New route N550 will run between Trafalgar Square and Canning Town via Victoria Embankment, Bank, Cornhill, Commercial Road, Westferry Road, Manchester Road, Prestons Road and East India Dock Road.</p>
<p>The N551 will operate between Trafalgar Square and Gallions Reach Shopping Park via the Strand, Ludgate Hill, Aldgate, The Highway, East India Dock Road, Canning Town, Victoria Dock Road, Tollgate Road, Woolwich Manor Way and Armada Way. </p>
<h2>Direct night-time link</h2>
