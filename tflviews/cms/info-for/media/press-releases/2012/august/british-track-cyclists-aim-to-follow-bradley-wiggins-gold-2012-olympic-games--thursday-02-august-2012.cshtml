 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Today's action packed day of cultural and sporting Olympic events includes the first indoor cycling events with thousands of spectators heading to the Velodrome to cheer on Team GB. </p>
<p>As another venue in the Olympic Park opens, public transport will be exceptionally busy at certain times and places on the network and people should visit GetAheadoftheGames.com to plan ahead.</p>
<p>Aside from the events at the Olympic Park, there a number of events taking place at other London venues, including three sessions of Beach Volleyball around Horse Guards Parade. </p>
<p>The Jubilee line will be busy in the morning and evening peak periods with events taking place at Lord's Cricket Ground, North Greenwich Arena, ExCel and the Olympic Park. </p>
<p>Other top tips for spectators attending sporting events today are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those travelling to or from Olympic Park should consider travelling via the District line at West Ham or by National Rail via Liverpool Street, as it may be quicker </li>
<li>Those attending the late night Beach Volleyball session at Horse Guards Parade, the Volleyball at Earls Court and the basketball at North Greenwich should check the time of their last train home</li></ul>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE, said: `As the number of Games events taking place across the capital increases we will see larger numbers of passengers at certain times and places. </p>
<p>`Where possible we are asking people to avoid the busiest times. Away from the sporting venues, London has an enormous array of attractions to offer during the Games, so I encourage everyone to enjoy the theatres, restaurants, shops, free concerts, Live Sites and attractions and to continue to use GetAheadoftheGames.com to plan your journeys.'</p>
<p>The public transport system remains busy with Tube journeys up by 10.5 per cent on Tuesday and record DLR ridership on Monday, up 65 per cent on what would be expected at this time of year. </p>
<p>Journeys to stations serving the West End on Monday remained at the same levels seen this time last year.</p>

<ul>
<li>If you have a ticket to a London 2012 event, make sure you don't miss it - check london2012.com for your recommended arrival times and leave plenty of time to travel </li>
<li>For a less crowded journey to the Olympic Park use the District or Hammersmith &amp; City line to West Ham, which is a short walk to the Olympic Park </li>
<li>Make sure you have the correct Games Travelcard for the day of your event </li>
<li>Re-check your travel plans before attending an event by using the Travel Planner at london2012.com/journey </li>
<li>Expect queues when arriving and departing venue stations. Leave plenty of time to get to your venue, and remember to check the times of your last train home with your operator </li>
<li>Live Sites offering free concerts will once again be in operation today.&nbsp; There are a number of other stations that can be used to enter the Hyde Park Live site including Bond Street, Marble Arch and Green Park</li></ul>
<p>TfL's key travel advice for today (Thursday, 2 August):</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-Games passengers should try to avoid the busiest times and places </li>
<li>The Olympic Route Network (ORN), including the Games Lanes, is now in operation and being enforced.&nbsp; Avoid driving in central London, around the ORN and venues </li>
<li>Games lanes are operating flexibly. Check the electronic roadside message signs which will clearly state if the Games Lanes are open to general traffic or reserved for Games vehicles. If you have to drive, plan ahead, consider re-timing your journey and allow more time </li>
<li>Events will be taking place at the Olympic Park, ExCeL, North Greenwich Arena, Greenwich Park, Royal Artillery Barracks, Horse Guards Parade, Earls Court, Lord's Cricket Ground, Wimbledon and Wembley Arena </li>
<li>As part of preparations for the Triathlon a technical rehearsal will take place, meaning Hyde Park Corner will close from 05:00hrs until around 09:00hrs on Thursday. The Piccadilly underpass will remain open throughout </li>
