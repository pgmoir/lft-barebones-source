<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced &pound;3.3m for Camden to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.</p>
<p>The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.<br></p>
<p>The &pound;3.3m funding package in 2013/14 in Camden will finance a range of transport projects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;300,000 for a number of measures on Kilburn High Road to reduce the high number of accidents, improve pedestrian and cycle routes providing east-west access to the new Barclays Cycle Superhighway, and sprucing up the area with new trees and new street furniture to improve the look and feel of the High Street</li>
<li>&pound;210,000 for road safety improvements and public realm improvements. Works will include the extension of the pedestrian pavement in the middle of Kingsway near Holborn tube station, new cycle parking and new street trees</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:&nbsp;'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Camden.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'</p>
<p>This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be coordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said:&nbsp;'We are working in partnership with Camden and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>Last year in Camden, it funded 136 on and off-street cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 672 children and 413 adults and 186 new trees.</p>
<p>Camden considers education and training programmes as important as engineering measures for improving road safety and promoting sustainable travel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>For example, this year they invested &pound;320,000 in their Smarter Travel programme, which includes pedestrian and cycle training, travel planning and road safety and sustainable travel campaigns and events. </p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<p>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp; While individual projects are the responsibility of each borough.</p>
