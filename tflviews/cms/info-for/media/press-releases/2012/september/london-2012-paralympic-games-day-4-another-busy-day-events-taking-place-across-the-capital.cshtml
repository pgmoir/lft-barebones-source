<p>Today (Sunday 2 September) will be another busy and exciting day of sporting and cultural events with Paralympic action in all seven venues in the Olympic Park, including South Africa's Oscar Pistorius, who is expected to take on his great rival Jerome Singleton of the US in the T44 200m final. </p>
<p>Events are also taking place at ExCeL, North Greenwich Arena, Greenwich Park and Royal Artillery Barracks, Eton Dorney and Weymouth, meaning that anyone planning to travel will need to plan ahead at GetAheadoftheGames.com</p>
<p>The Jubilee and Central lines, from central London to Stratford, and the DLR network will be particularly busy. </p>
<p>Javelin services to and from the Olympic Park will also be busy today and throughout the Paralympic Games, in both the morning and the evening.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Spectators heading to or from the Olympic Park are being asked to consider using c2c, District and Hammersmith &amp; City lines to or from West Ham and to access the Park via the Greenway. </p>
<p>This will help avoid the crowds. Passengers with reduced mobility should use Stratford station, where assistance is available.&nbsp; </p>
<p>National rail services between Liverpool Street and Stratford should also be considered.</p>
<p>All passengers are advised to leave extra travel time and to plan ahead to avoid the busiest times and places by visiting GetAheadoftheGames.com.</p>
<p>Today will also see the annual Regent Street Festival, with a celebration of the 'mile of style' at the heart of numerous events taking place throughout the day.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Regent Street, Lower Regent Street, Piccadilly Circus and Waterloo Place have been closed to all traffic since yesterday with roads scheduled to re-open in the early hours of Monday 3 September. </p>
<p>Shaftesbury Avenue will also be closed at Cambridge Circus between 12:00 and 22:00 today. </p>
<p>These road closures will mean temporary diversions in place in the West End for all traffic, including buses, so road users are advised to plan ahead at GetAheadoftheGames.com. </p>
<p>The Tube stations closest to the Regent Street Festival are Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus, served by the Bakerloo, Victoria, Central and Piccadilly lines.</p>
<p>Where possible, driving on or around the Paralympic Route Network (PRN) and near venue areas should be avoided, particularly around the Olympic Park in Stratford and the A102 approach roads north and south of the Blackwall Tunnel.</p>
<p>The A2, A12 and A13, and roads east of St Pauls, including those in and approaching the City such as Upper Thames Street and Lower Thames Street, and roads around Games venues are busier than usual.&nbsp; If driving is your only option, please travel at a different time if possible or allow more time for your journey.</p>
<p>Trafalgar Square and Potters Field Live Sites will operate throughout the Paralympic Games.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are a number of stations that can be used to access Trafalgar Square including Charing Cross and Embankment Station, and Potters Field is within walking distance of Borough Station.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE, said: `With all seven venues in use today at the Olympic Park and sporting action taking place at several other venues in the east of the city, along with fantastic cultural events including the Regent Street Festival, we want to remind people to plan ahead.&nbsp; </p>
<p>`We are asking them to take the same sensible steps they did during the Olympics and avoid the busiest times and places and avoid driving around venues and the PRN.&nbsp; Everything you need to plan your journey and avoid disruption as you head out and about to enjoy the various events and attractions can be found at GetAheadoftheGames.com.'</p>
