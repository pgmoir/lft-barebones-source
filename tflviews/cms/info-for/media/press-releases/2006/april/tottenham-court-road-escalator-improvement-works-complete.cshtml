            <p>The essential improvement work was carried out by Tube Lines and forms part of Transport for London's (TfL's) &pound;10bn 5-Year Investment Programme to improve and expand London's transport network.</p>
<p>The work was concluded on Friday 21 April and will improve the reliability of the 24-year-old escalator linking the Northern line platforms to the station concourse. </p>
<p>Temporary restrictions to Northern line access at peak times have now been lifted, providing a smoother journey for passengers. </p>
<p>Frank McGahren, Group Station Manager, said: "We're working hard to deliver a safer, reliable and clean Tube service every day. </p>
<p>"The completion of this escalator refurbishment work will mean passengers can now enjoy a smoother and more reliable journey through Tottenham Court Road.</p>
<p>"The investment into modernising our assets is just part of our commitment to improving the overall journey experience for passengers."</p>
<p>The restored peak-time access to the Northern line will be particularly beneficial for passengers interchanging with the Central line, including those seeking alternative routes due to the five-month closure of the Waterloo & City line for major improvement work. </p>
