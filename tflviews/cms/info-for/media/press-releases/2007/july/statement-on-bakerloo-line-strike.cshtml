<p>Commenting on the proposed RMT strike action on the Bakerloo line on Friday 20 July, a TfL spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"This strike action is completely unnecessary and will not achieve anything.<br>"It is normal practice on the Bakerloo line, and across the network, that if two station staff are unavailable to ensure that the train is empty before it is returned to the depot, then the driver will assist. <br>"There has been an anomaly on this part of the Bakerloo Line which has meant that the train can only be cleared by two station staff and the driver cannot help on the rare occasions when two station staff are not available. <br>"This anomaly has caused unnecessary delays, inconveniencing passengers and sometimes resulting in a loss of services. <br>"The change in procedure is to correct this anomaly. <br>"There is no compromise on safety." </p>
