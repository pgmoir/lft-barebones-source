        More than 150,000 drivers are now reaping the rewards of signing up to automatically pay the Congestion Charge.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>By registering to use the CC Auto Pay system they know they need never be fined again and the system is now the most popular way to pay the Charge.</p>
<p>CC Auto Pay was introduced in January 2011 and provides a simple, easy way for drivers to automatically pay the Congestion Charge with customers getting a &pound;1 discount from the &pound;10 daily charge at the same time.</p>
<p>Drivers who register will only ever be charged for the days they travel within the zone and charges will be automatically deducted from their nominated debit or credit card.</p>
<h2>Thousands of new accounts</h2>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) launched CC Auto Pay accounts on 4 January, with pre-registration available from November 2010.</p>
<p>Since the launch of CC Auto Pay over three&nbsp;million payments have been processed for over 200,000 vehicles registered to the 150,000 accounts now set up for CC Auto Pay.</p>
<p>TfL's Director of Congestion Charging, Nick Fairholme, said: 'The benefits of CC Auto Pay are self evident and we are delighted that so many people have signed up for accounts.</p>
<p>'Drivers who do so are saving money and safe in the knowledge that they will never be fined for forgetting to pay.' </p>
<p>To register for a CC Auto Pay account drivers will need a credit or debit card and will have to pay a &pound;10 annual registration fee for each vehicle on the account.&nbsp; Motorists can register for a CC Auto Pay account at <a href="http://www.cclondon.com">www.cclondon.com</a> </p>
