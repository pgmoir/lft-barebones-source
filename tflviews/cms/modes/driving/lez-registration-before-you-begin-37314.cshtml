      <h2>Before you start</h2>

<p>Before we can process your LEZ registration, you need to set up a London Road User Charging account.</p>

<h3>Setting up a London Road User Charging account</h3>

<p>To create an account, click on 'Continue' and complete all required fields. You can also set up optional services, such as mobile phone text alerts, to help you manage your account. (Sign in now if you already have an account.)</p>

<h4>Benefits of a London Road User Charging account</h4>

<p>Having an account with us means you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>View your vehicle details</li>
	<li>Allow up to <strong>5 </strong>people access to your London Road User Charging account</li>
</ul>

<h3>Registering your vehicle with us</h3>

<p>Once your London Road User Charging account has been created and you sign in, you will be automatically directed to register your vehicle(s).</p>

<p>Most vehicles registered in the United Kingdom don't need to be registered with us.</p>

<p>If you believe we hold incorrect or insufficient information about your vehicle to accurately determine the LEZ charge due, you can register your vehicle with us.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicles registered in the United Kingdom:</strong></p>

<p>You will only need to register your vehicle with us if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We think it does not <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/low-emission-zone/check-if-your-vehicle-is-affected">meet the LEZ emissions standards</a> but you can provide documentary evidence that it does</li>
	<li>You are a <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/low-emission-zone/check-if-your-vehicle-is-affected/exemptions-and-discounts">showman with a modified or specially constructed vehicle</a></li>
	<li>Your vehicle is being charged the &pound;200 daily LEZ charge and you can provide evidence that it should be charged the &pound;100 daily LEZ Charge</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Vehicles registered outside the United Kingdom:</strong></p>

<p>You will need to register your vehicle with us if:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It meets the LEZ emissions standards</li>
	<li>It qualifies for an <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/low-emission-zone/check-if-your-vehicle-is-affected/exemptions-and-discounts">exemption or discount</a></li>
	<li>Your vehicle is registered in Northern Ireland, has a full filter and has been issued with a Reduced Pollution Certificate (RPC)</li>
	<li>Your vehicle is being charged the &pound;200 daily LEZ charge&nbsp;and you can provide evidence that it should be charged the &pound;100 daily LEZ charge</li>
</ul>
