<p>Today (17 February) is the fifth anniversary of the central London Congestion Charge. </p>
<p>The charge has won plaudits across the globe and helped London become the only major city in the world to see a significant shift from private car use to public transport, walking and cycling. </p>
<p>The level of traffic within the zone is down 21 per cent since the introduction of the charge. </p>
<p>The level of congestion is down eight per cent. </p>
<p>Public transport use has boomed with record numbers of more than one billion passengers a year are using the Tube, a 45 per cent increase in the use of buses and 43 per cent increase in cycling within the zone. </p>
<h2>London's example </h2>

<p>The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: "The congestion charge and the biggest investment programme since the second world war has enabled London to become the first major city in the world to achieve a shift away from the private car to public transport.</p>
<p>"The charge is also reducing pollution and I am building on this by altering the charge to penalise the big vehicles which contribute most to climate change and exempting the cleanest cars.</p>
<p>"Nationally and internationally cities are following London's example and considering introducing a similar charge. </p>
<p>"The congestion charge has made London a world leader in doing something about traffic congestion and pollution rather than just talking about it."</p>
<h2>Fewer vehicles </h2>

<p>Before charging began, some 334,000 vehicles entered the original charging zone each day. </p>
<p>Some 70,000 fewer vehicles now enter the same area on a daily basis and there has been a five per cent shift from private car usage to public transport, cycling and walking. </p>
<p>London's buses carried 1.9 billion passengers in 2006/07, an increase of 45 per cent from 1999/2000. </p>
<p>Traffic in the western extension of the Congestion Charge scheme, which marks its first anniversary on February 19, is down by 10 to 15 per cent on 2006. </p>
<h2>Groundbreaking initiatives </h2>

<p>And congestion has been reduced by between 20 and 25 per cent compared with similar periods in 2005 and 2006. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: "Without the Congestion Charge, which has reduced the number of vehicles coming into central London by 70,000 a day, London would have ground to a halt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"It has also helped transform London's bus network into one of the best in the world.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"There are now 6.3 million bus journeys every day in the Capital.</p>
<p>"Congestion Charging paved the way for further groundbreaking initiatives in London's transport and environment programme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Earlier this month, the whole of Greater London was designated a clean air Low Emission Zone, the largest of its type anywhere in the world."</p>
