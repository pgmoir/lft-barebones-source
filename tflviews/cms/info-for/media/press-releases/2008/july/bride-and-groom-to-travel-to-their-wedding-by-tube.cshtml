<p>The couple will be boarding a London Underground train at Dollis Hill Tube station on the Jubilee line to go to the register office in Marylebone in central London. </p>
<p>The couple are very environmentally conscious and wanted to travel to this special event by public transport.</p>
<p>Their friends and relatives will also be joining them on the Tube on the big day.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bride Stefanie Schmiedel, a teacher and German national resident in the UK, said: 'It is important for both of us to have an environmentally friendly wedding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'I have been encouraging my relatives to travel over from Germany by Eurostar or by coach, as opposed to flying the short distance.'&nbsp; </p>
<p>Groom Robert Gray, speech therapist, said: 'We live quite close to our local station in Dollis Hill and the registry office is not far from Baker Street station, so what better way to travel there than by Tube?'</p>
<p>Penny Hazell, Jubilee line General Manager, said: 'We're delighted that this bride and groom have chosen to go to their wedding by Tube.</p>
<p>'Public transport is a sustainable way to travel around the Capital.</p>
<p>'London Underground is not only convenient for commuters and tourists but also for people on their way to a very special event like a wedding.</p>
<p>'We wish them all the best.'</p>
<p>Other green aspects of Robert and Stefanie's wedding include: the bride's dress, which&nbsp;is made from dyable material and reusable; invitations, menus and the order of ceremony, which&nbsp;are homemade using recycled paper; the catering at the reception which will use local produce; the organic wedding cake; the honeymoon trip round Europe by train, and the second-hand engagement ring.</p>
<p>Both Robert and Stefanie are members of Brent Friends of the Earth.&nbsp; </p>
