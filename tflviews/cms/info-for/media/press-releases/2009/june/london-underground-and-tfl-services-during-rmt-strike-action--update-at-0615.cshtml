 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Services are running on more than half of all London Underground lines this morning, including a good service on the Northern line. </p>
<p>Service levels are the same as those achieved on Wednesday morning, and London Underground aims to build on these services as the day progresses.</p>
<p>Richard Parry, Interim Managing Director of London Underground, said: 'I want to join Londoners in thanking our hard-working Tube and transport staff who came to work yesterday and kept London moving, and got many thousands of football fans to and from last night's England match at Wembley.</p>
<p>'We're running services on more than half of our lines this morning, and I hope that we will be able to add to that throughout the day. </p>
<p>'Those travelling in London should continue to check before they travel, and we will keep doing everything possible to get you to where you need to be.'</p>
