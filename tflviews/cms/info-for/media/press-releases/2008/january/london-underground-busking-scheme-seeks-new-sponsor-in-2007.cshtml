            <p>Passengers travelling on the Underground from January 2007 will notice that the familiar half moon Carling branded busking pitches have been replaced network-wide by new LU designs. </p>
<p>The LU busking scheme was sponsored by Carling since the scheme began three years ago. </p>
<p>In May 2003, LU won the right to change the laws and the bylaws to make busking legal on the Underground. </p>
<p>Starting as a 16 week trial the scheme was an overnight success and has gradually expanded through the years. </p>
<p>The scheme now counts over 356 buskers entertaining millions of commuters each day on 30 pitches in 22 stations and providing over 3,000 hours of entertainment each week.</p>
<p>Steve Lewis, Contracts Manager, Advertising &amp; Sponsorship said: <br>"The scheme in collaboration with Carling has been very successful. </p>
<p>"It will remain managed in house until a suitable sponsor is selected to help this unique and successful initiative to keep on flourishing and developing."</p>
<p>"LU is also working in collaboration with CBS Outdoor (LU's Advertising Contractor) to seek sponsorship.</p>
<p>"The London Underground busking scheme was originally implemented as a result from customer demand for talented musicians to be licensed to perform on the Underground. </p>
<p>"London Underground's passengers have made this scheme a success through their generosity and support of the buskers who are not paid to play on the Underground."</p>
            <ul>
<li>The LU busking initiative was originally launched from 19 May 2003 to 6 June 2003 after LU won the right in 2001 to change national law and the local bylaws to legalise licensed busking</li>
<li>The scheme was developed as a response to customer demand for talented musicians being licensed to play at stations</li>
<li>Licensed buskers are chosen on talent, with emphasis strongly placed on meeting the wide-ranging musical tastes of Tube passengers</li>
<li>Buskers are not paid by LU and rely on the generosity of Tube passengers</li>
<li>All buskers have to pass an audition in front of a judging panel and are vetted for any police convictions before they are issued a London Underground Busking Licence</li>
<li>The scheme's overnight success resulted in its gradual expansion in the last three years: there are now 33 pitches in 22 stations and 356 licensed buskers</li>
