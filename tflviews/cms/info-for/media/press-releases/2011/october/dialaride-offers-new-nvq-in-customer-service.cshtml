            <p>The new National Vocational Qualification (Level 2) in Customer Service is being offered as part of the Mayor's commitment to increase the number of work based learning apprenticeships in Transport for London (TfL).&nbsp; </p>
<p>The NVQ is recognised across all industries in the UK.</p>
<p>The new on-the-job training will be provided in addition to the BTEC-based training drivers already undertake and includes improved disability equality and awareness training.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The drivers will be offered the opportunity to train in basic verbal and numerical skills at nationally recognised standards.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Always looking to improve</h2>
<p>This, along with the BTEC and the NVQ in Customer Service make up an Adult Apprenticeship. <br>&nbsp; <br>Joyce Mamode, Dial-a-Ride Head of Passenger Services said: 'We are always looking to improve the service we provide to our passengers and having highly trained staff can help us do that.</p>
<p>'Through this qualification our drivers will learn and recognise the importance and value of offering excellent service.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'As well as offering this to new drivers, we will also be extending it to drivers who already work for us.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Developing skills</h2>
<p>'It provides an opportunity to improve their skills, build confidence, boost motivation and receive a nationally recognised qualification.'</p>
<p>More than 10,000 NVQs have been awarded to staff throughout TfL since 2001 which has improved skills and boosted morale.</p>
<p>NVQs build on the already substantial training TfL staff receive allowing them to develop the skills and knowledge necessary to improve in their role and achieve a recognised qualification.</p>
<p>Iain Smith, TL's Head of Skills, said: 'Being able to offer such opportunities to our staff is essential to ensure TfL's customers receive the best possible service from staff who keep London moving both on the frontline and behind the scenes.' </p>
<h2>Real evidence</h2>
<p>Staff can gain NVQs in Rail Operations, Rail Engineering, Customer Services, Administration and Management, and programmes last between one to two years. </p>
<p>The courses are integrated as much as possible with the staff member's day job to avoid unnecessary repetition and also capture real evidence of performance.<br></p>
