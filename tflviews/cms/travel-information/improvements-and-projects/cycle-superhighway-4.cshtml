        Cycleway 4 will create a continuous segregated cycle route between Tower Bridge and Greenwich, and improve public spaces and facilities for people who are walking. We plan to finish the Tooley Street and Jamaica Road sections in spring 2020.

<h2>Benefits of Cycleway 4</h2>

<p>Cycleway 4 will create a clearer and safer route for cycling on roads in Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, Deptford and Greenwich. New pedestrian crossings will also be added and public spaces improved to make these areas more pleasant to live, work, shop and spend time in.</p>

<p>Our plan also allows for the area's future growth. Cycleway 4 will help connect communities along the route by linking important amenities and facilities.</p>

<p>Our expanding network of cycle routes is an important part of the <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/the-mayors-transport-strategy">Mayor's Transport Strategy</a> and <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/healthy-streets">Healthy Streets Approach</a>&nbsp; - these aim to encourage walking, cycling and public transport and make London greener, healthier and more pleasant.</p>

<p>Our proposals for Cycleway 4 include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two-way segregated cycle track on Tooley Street, Jamaica Road, Evelyn Street and Creek Road</li>
	<li>Five new signal-controlled pedestrian crossings and upgrades to over 20 existing pedestrian crossings</li>
	<li>Building on the recent short-term improvements at Rotherhithe roundabout by redesigning the roundabout to improve safety as part of our <a href="/campaign/our-plan-for-londons-roads">Safer Junctions programme</a></li>
	<li>Installing a new eastbound bus gate on the Jamaica Road approach to Rotherhithe roundabout. This will give buses priority at the roundabout and give them easier access into Lower Road</li>
	<li>New and improved public spaces at Deptford High Street and Rotherhithe roundabout, including new paving and trees</li>
	<li>New traffic restrictions including banned turns on some side roads along Jamaica Road and at Deptford High Street</li>
	<li>Changes to some bus stop layouts and locations, including new bus stop bypasses for cyclists</li>
</ul>

<h2>Change of name</h2>

<p>Cycleway 4 was called Cycle Superhighway 4. Throughout 2019 we will be combining most Cycle Superhighways and Quietways into the single <a href="/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/cycleways">Cycleways network</a>.</p>

<h2>Consultation</h2>

<p>We consulted on proposals for what will be Cycleway 4 in autumn 2017. See our response to issues raised during the consultation on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/cs4/">Cycle Superhighway 4 consultation page</a>.</p>

<h2>Lower Road</h2>

<p>Southwark Council consulted on detailed proposals for the Lower Road section of the route in July-October 2019. This included their proposals to make some roads in the area two-way.</p>
