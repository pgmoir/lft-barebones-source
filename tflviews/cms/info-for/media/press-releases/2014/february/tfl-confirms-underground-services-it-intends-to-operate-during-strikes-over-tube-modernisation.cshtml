<p>
Our customers and staff are at the very centre of our plans for London Underground. All Tube stations will remain staffed and controlled at all times when services are operating, and we'll be introducing a 24-hour service at weekends during 2015.
</p>
</div>
<p>LU is consulting with trade unions and staff over its vision for the future of the Tube, which includes a new 24-hour 'Night Tube' service at weekends and more staff visible and available in public areas of Tube stations to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys and to keep them safe and secure.</p>
<p>Despite two poorly-supported ballots for industrial action, which saw only around 30 per cent of RMT and TSSA members balloted voting for strike action, and around 70 per cent either not voting or voting no, the union leaderships have nonetheless instructed their members to carry out four days of strike action in February. </p>
<p>Two 48-hour strikes have been called at LU which will affect services from:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Around 9.30pm on Tuesday 4 February until the morning of Friday 7 February; and, </li>
    <li>Around 9.30pm on Tuesday 11 February until the morning of Friday 14 February.</li>
</ul>
<p>The leaderships of the RMT and TSSA unions continue to threaten Londoners with strike action despite a series of commitments made to Tube customers and staff by LU Managing Director, Mike Brown MVO including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Every Tube station will be visibly staffed and controlled by LU staff during operating hours; </li>
    <li>There will be a job for everyone who wants to continue to be part of our organisation and who is ready to be flexible; </li>
    <li>Any operational changes will be done without compulsory redundancies where we can collaborate to make change happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>LU Managing Director, Mike Brown MVO said: </p>
<p>'Our customers and staff are at the very centre of our plans for London Underground. All Tube stations will remain staffed and controlled at all times when services are operating, and we'll be introducing a 24-hour service at weekends during 2015. </p>
<p>In future, there will be more staff in ticket halls and on platforms to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys and to keep them safe and secure.</p>
<p>'We're committed to implement these changes without compulsory redundancies and there'll be a job for everyone at LU who wants to work for us and be flexible.</p>
<p>'My message to the unions leaderships is that it's not too late to do the right thing, call off this completely unnecessary strike and work with us to help shape the future of the Tube. </p>
<p>All a strike will achieve is to lose those who take part four days' pay. </p>
<p>Should the strike go ahead, we'll do all we can to keep customers informed and ensure we keep London moving and open for business.'</p>
<p><strong>Travel advice to customers during RMT and TSSA strike action:</strong></p>
<p>Should the RMT and TSSA strike action go ahead, LU will keep as many stations open and run as many trains as possible. </p>
<p>Services will be affected from 21:30hrs on Tuesday 4 February so customers are asked to try to complete journeys as early as possible that evening. </p>
<p>If your Oyster card needs topping up, it may help to do this in advance of the industrial action starting.</p>
<p>There will be disruption to journeys on Wednesday and Thursday, when Tube services will start later and finish earlier than normal - trains will run from around 07:00hrs to 23:00hrs.</p>
<p>Although it is not possible to say exactly what services we will be able to run, the line-by-line information below will help customers to plan journeys in advance.</p>
<p>However, customers are advised that the situation may change throughout the day.  </p>
<p>Buses and other modes of transport will also be very busy.</p>
<p>The strike planned by ASLEF at London Tramlink which would have affected services on Wednesday 5 February has been called off.</p>
<p>Those members of TfL staff who are on duty during the strike will be doing their very best to keep London moving and open for business. </p>
<p>TfL asks customers for their patience during what may be difficult journeys. </p>
<p>Trained TfL Ambassadors and volunteers will also be on hand to provide customers with travel information and advice on the ground. </p>
<p>TfL urges all customers to plan ahead and to check before they travel at tfl.gov.uk and by following &#64;TfLTravelAlerts, &#64;TfLTrafficNews and &#64;TfLBusAlerts on Twitter.</p>

                        <li>Better customer service: The trend of ticket sales away from ticket offices has surged over recent years and today less than three per cent of all Tube journeys involve a visit to a ticket office. In future, therefore, rather than being remote from customers behind closed doors or glass windows, Tube station staff will be based in ticket halls, on gate lines and on platforms, ready and available to give the best personal and face-to-face service to customers;</li>
                        <li>Improving reliability and capacity: The huge Tube improvement programme underway will continue, with billions of pounds of investment to deliver more frequent, reliable and accessible services and enhanced stations, providing greater capacity to tackle increasing numbers of customers. It also includes a continued rigorous focus on improving customer journeys and meeting the Mayor's commitment of reducing delays by a further 30 per cent by 2015, when compared to 2011 reliability levels. Across the Tube network, delays to customers' journeys have been reduced by 37 per cent since 2008/09 and 53 per cent since 2003.</li>
                        <li>Night Tube: From 2015, weekend services will run through the night on core parts of the system - initially comprised of services on the Piccadilly, Victoria, Central, Jubilee and Northern lines. This network, which will be expanded to include other lines in subsequent years, will dovetail with existing 24-hour and Night Bus services to give passengers an extensive and integrated service throughout the night.<br /></li>
