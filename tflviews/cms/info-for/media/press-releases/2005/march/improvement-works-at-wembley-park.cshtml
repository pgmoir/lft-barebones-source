<p>Kevin Bootle, Jubilee line General Manager said: "Wembley Park Station is undergoing a major reconstruction. This will make it more pleasant to use and increase the station's capacity so that it will be ready for the opening of the new Wembley Stadium.</p>
<p>"I apologise for the inconvenience caused, but when this work is completed it will bring real benefits to passengers."</p>
<p>A Rail Replacement Bus service will operate between Neasden and Kingsbury calling at Wembley Park.</p>
<p>A 15 minute train service will operate between Stanmore and Kingsbury.</p>
<p>Passengers should allow an extra 40 minutes for their journeys, particularly if they are travelling late at night to central London from Wembley Park Station or north or west of it, in order to catch last train connections.</p>
