            <p> The station is served by two escalators. One was undergoing routine maintenance and being used as a fixed stairway when the second escalator failed during the evening of January 19. <br> <br>In keeping with safety regulations, the station was immediately closed. </p>
<p>Tube Lines, the contractor responsible for maintaining and upgrading the Northern line, including this station, is now investigating the cause and undertaking repair work.<br> <br>George McInulty, LU Service Director, said: "I apologise to passengers for this inconvenience but safety on our stations must come first.<br> <br>"Initial investigations indicate that repair of one of these escalators may take some weeks. </p>
<p>"We will update station users on its re-opening time as soon as Tube Lines give us more information about the cause of the failure and when they expect to complete the work."<br> <br>Tube Lines engineers are working round the clock to repair one of the escalators to enable the station to open as soon as possible</p>
<p>Local bus routes are accepting LU tickets.</p>
