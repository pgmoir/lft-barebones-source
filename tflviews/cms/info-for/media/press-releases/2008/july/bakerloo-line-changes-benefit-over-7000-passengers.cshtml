        Over the last two months, more than 7,000 London Underground passengers travelling to and from northwest London have benefited from improvements to the Bakerloo line timetable.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The timetable changes, which came into effect on Sunday 18 May, mean that all trains that used to terminate at Willesden Junction now continue onto Stonebridge Park. </p>
<p>In addition, the first train on weekdays, which used to start at Queen's Park station, now begins at Stonebridge Park, thereby serving an additional four stations.<br>&nbsp;<br>Bakerloo line manager Lance Ramsay said: 'We estimate that this is helping over 7,000 customers every weekday. </p>
<h2>Timetable changes</h2>
<p>'Not only those customers who previously had to get off the train at Willesden Junction because it terminated there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'They can now travel on to Harlesden or Stonebridge Park stations without breaking their journeys.</p>
<p>'But also those passengers from Stonebridge Park, Harlesden, Willesden Junction and Kensal Green stations who have been able to get on an earlier first train in the morning.'</p>
<p>Last year eleven Silverlink stations transferred to London Underground (LU) including Stonebridge Park station which enabled LU to construct&nbsp;additional staff accommodation at that station.</p>
