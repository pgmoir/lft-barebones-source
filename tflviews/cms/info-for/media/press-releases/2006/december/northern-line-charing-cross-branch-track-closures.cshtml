            <p>This will see weekend closures from Camden to Kennington on most weekends from 6 January to 9 April.</p>
<p>The essential track replacement is part of the upgrade of the Northern line.</p>
<p>The upgrade, due to be delivered by 2012, will include the installation of a new signalling system which, together with the new track, will deliver a faster, more frequent, and more reliable service for passengers.</p>
<p>The upgrade will cut journey times by an average of 18 per cent, and boost passenger capacity by 21 per cent.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, London Underground announced a major increase in the level of engineering work taking place on the Tube at weekends as part of Transport for London's &pound;10 billion Investment Programme to improve and expand London's transport network.</p>
<p>The work on the Northern line is being undertaken by Tube Lines.</p>
<p>During the weekend work, there will be no service on the Northern line's Charing Cross branch between Camden Town and Kennington.</p>
<p>Passengers should also be aware of a reduced service on the rest of the Northern line.</p>
<p>Mornington Crescent and Goodge Streets stations will also be closed as they are not served by any other Underground line.</p>
<p>David Millard, General Manager, Northern line said: 'The extensive nature of these much needed track replacement works means that it is not possible for it to be undertaken during normal engineering hours and therefore a number of weekend closures are required.</p>
<p>'By carrying out the work at weekends we will limit the extent of customer disruption as fewer people are travelling.</p>
<p>'Following completion of the renewal works, customers should experience an improvement in performance and reliability on the Northern line.'</p>
<p>Passengers are encouraged to check before they travel on the Tube at weekends and plan alternative Tube or bus routes via the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The TfL website: <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tubeworks">www.tfl.gov.uk/tubeworks</a> 
</li><li>The London Travel Info 24hrs telephone helpline: 020-7222 1234 
</li><li>BBC Ceefax, page 436, or ITV's Teletext, page 164 
</li><li>Information on posters, leaflets and "Good Service" boards at stations</li></ul>
            <ul>
<li>TfL is investing &pound;10bn over the next five years to improve and expand London's transport network, more than half of that in the Tube</li>
<li>Weekend closures will start on 6 January 2007 and will continue every weekend until the weekend of 24/25 March inclusive followed by the Easter Bank Holiday - Friday 6 April to Monday 9 April 2007</li>
<li>Tube Lines Ltd is responsible for renewal and maintenance of the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines<br></li></ul>
