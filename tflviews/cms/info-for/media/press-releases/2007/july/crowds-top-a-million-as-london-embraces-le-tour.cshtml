London has embraced Le Tour

<p>Commenting on today's successful day Peter Hendy, London's Transport Commissioner said:</p>
<p>"It's been a fantastic day.  London has embraced Le Tour.  Crowds of over a million have exceeded our expectations.</p>
<p>"The four years of planning we and our partners put in has seen everything run like clockwork.  Public transport has run smoothly throughout the day, demonstrating once again London's ability to host great events.</p>
<p>"We hope that hosting the Tour de France will provide a further boost to cycling in the capital and across the UK, building on the 83% increase we have already seen since 2000.  And we'd love to see the Tour back in London again."</p>
