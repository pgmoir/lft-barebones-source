<p>A new fully walk-through Tube train which allows better access for customers has started running between Hammersmith and Barking. </p>
<p>It is the first of 53 new trains that will eventually roll out on the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines later next year.</p>
<p>Trains on the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines are currently comprised of six carriages. </p>
<p>The new trains will be longer, providing 17 per cent extra capacity and relieving pressure on busy parts of the network.</p>
<p>Nigel Holness, Director of Operational Change and Upgrades, London Underground, said: 'This is great news for our customers in the east end of London. The trains are longer, walk-through and in the summer customers will be able to benefit from the air conditioning too. </p>
<p>'It is the first of 53 new trains that will operate on the Hammersmith &amp; City and Circle lines and will start rolling out in earnest from Spring next year.'</p>
<p>In addition the trains will have automated visual displays and station announcements, plus CCTV, as well as dedicated wheelchair areas, wider doors and walkways, lower passenger alarms and a smaller gap between the train and platform.</p>
<p>The roll out of the first train along the complete route of the Hammersmith &amp; City line also marks the completion of works at Hammersmith station and depot to accommodate the new longer trains. </p>
<p>This included extending the platforms and tracks and building a new ticket office and train crew depot. <br></p>

<p><strong>Notes to Editors: </strong></p>
<p>London Underground awarded Bombardier Transportation the contract to upgrade the signalling on the Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines in June 2011.The new signalling system, when complete, will mean customers can travel more quickly, and frequently on all of the Sub-Surface lines, which together make up 40 per cent of the Tube network and increase capacity. These improvements include: </p>
<ul>
<li>24 per cent more capacity on the District line by providing space for an extra 10,000 passengers an hour - increasing the line's capacity from 40,000 to 50,000 passengers an hour</li>
<li>27 per cent more capacity on the Metropolitan line by providing space for an extra 9,500 more passengers an hour - increasing the line's capacity from 35,000 to 44,500 passengers an hour</li>
<li>65 per cent more capacity on the Circle and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, delivered through new signalling, longer trains and recent improvements to service frequency. In total the upgrade will provide space for an extra 17,500 more passengers each hour - increasing the capacity from 26,000 to 43,500 passengers an hour. <br></li></ul>
