        We are working hard to find a means to re-open Battersea Bridge to allow traffic to use it safely after this accident, however the damage is extensive and the analysis of it complex.

<p>TfL will be looking to the operator/owner of the boat and its insurers to cover the full costs associated with necessary repairs.</p>
<p>The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: "On the basis of the information we currently have there is no intention to close the bridge but clearly, after a major accident like this, we will have to consider all appropriate options as more information becomes available as to the extent of the damage to the bridge and the safety implications."</p>
<p>The London Traffic Control Centre reports that drivers have adapted well to the difficulties caused by the closure of the bridge and the network around the area is operating well, apart from slight heavier periods during the evening peak. </p>
<p><h2>Pedestrians and cyclists</h2></p>
<p>Travellers are asked, where possible, to avoid Chelsea Embankment westbound while local diversions are in place or to allow extra time for journeys which involve travelling to or through this area - especially when there are local events such as football taking place.</p>
<p>The bridge is likely to remain closed to vehicles for some weeks and TfL would like to thank drivers for their patience. </p>
<p>It is currently open to pedestrian traffic and cyclists only.</p>
<p>The following roads remain closed: Battersea Bridge Road northbound with the junction of Prince of Wales Drive and Beaufort Street southbound with the junction of King's Road. </p>
<p>Bus routes 49, 239, 319, 345 and night bus N31 continue to be diverted.</p>
