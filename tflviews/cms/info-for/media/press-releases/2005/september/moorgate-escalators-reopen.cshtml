                            I'm delighted that these escalators are back serving customers, and six weeks early

            <p>Since September 2004, the two escalators between the Northern line ticket hall and the Northern line platforms, with components dating back to the 1920s, had been closed so that Metronet Rail SSL could completely replace both machines. </p>
<p>The work is part of Transport for London's 5-year &pound;10bn investment programme.</p>
<p>City-bound WAGN rail services, which had been terminating at Old Street and King's Cross during the morning peak, have now resumed their service to Moorgate.</p>
<p>Moorgate's Group Station Manager, Tom O'Riordan, said: "I'm delighted that these escalators are back serving customers, and six weeks early. </p>
<p>"I'd like to thank all those involved in making this happen and, most importantly, our customers for their patience and co-operation."</p>
<p>Replacement of these escalators was originally planned to take a full 12 months but Metronet Rail SSL were able to re-open the escalators six weeks earlier than planned.</p>
