        Due to cold weather, the A3220 is closed following a burst Thames Water hydrant.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The A3220 West Cross Route in Hammersmith and Fulham has been closed between the A40 Northern Roundabout and Holland Park roundabout due to a burst Thames Water hydrant and low temperatures which could turn the water to ice.&nbsp; </p>
<p>With temperatures due to fall below zero this evening and overnight there is the potential for the water to freeze, making the roads slippery and dangerous.</p>
<p>As highway authority for the A3220 it is Transport for London's (TfL's) responsibility to ensure the safe movement of traffic.</p>
<p>Therefore, the decision has been made to close the carriageway until conditions are deemed safe.</p>
<p>Advance information signs have been placed in the area and drivers are advised to find alternative routes.</p>
<p>Information on alternative routes and updates on the closure can be found at <a href="http://trafficalerts.tfl.gov.uk">trafficalerts.tfl.gov.uk</a> or by calling TfL's travel line on 020 7222 1234.</p>
<p>Thames Water is working to repair the problem as quickly as possible.</p>
