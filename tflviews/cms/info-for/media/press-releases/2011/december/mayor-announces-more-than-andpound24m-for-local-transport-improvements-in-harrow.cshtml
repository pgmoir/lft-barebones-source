        The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has today announced more than &pound;2.4m for transport improvements in Harrow.
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, </p>
<p>Smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking. </p>
<p>The &pound;2.4m funding package in 2012/13 will finance a range of transport projects in Harrow, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;100,000 to implement a range of measures along key routes to facilitate efficient freight vehicle movement and reduce disruption to residents by inappropriate use of roads by large vehicles</li>
<li>&pound;100,000 for a package of measures to reduce motorcycle collisions. Sites identified include: Bridge Street, Elm Park, Chapel Lane and Imperial Drive between North Harrow and Farm Avenue</li>
<li>&pound;140,000 to introduce traffic calming 20mph zones around Roxbourne, Elmgrove and Weald Schools</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'London is undergoing a neo-Victorian level of investment in its transport network.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'</p>
<p>The LIP funds hundreds of large- and small-scale transport projects every year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Last year in Harrow it financed 38 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 717 children and 234 adults, two 20mph zones, 53 accessible bus stops, 34 schools participating in walking events and 424 trees.</p>
<p>Notable larger projects already undertaken in Harrow using LIP support include the &pound;3m Harrow Town Centre Major Scheme, which included two-way bus operation in Station Road as well as public realm improvements with improved crossings, better lighting, paving and measures to improve safety and security.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'</p>
<p>The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14. </p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp;While TfL allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough </li>
<li>A detailed breakdown of funding for bridge strengthening projects (&pound;5.3m), which will be allocated to the bridges in most need of work will be announced in the New Year </li>
<li>Total allocation by programme area:</li></ul>
