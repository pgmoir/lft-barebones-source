            <p>As part of its ongoing road safety work, Transport for London (TfL) is reminding London's teenagers to remain careful when nearby or using London roads. </p>
<p>While the clock change signals the start of the summer months and longer, lighter evenings, it will also mean that mornings will be darker. </p>
<h2>Dark mornings</h2>
<p>During the first few weeks of April some teenagers will find themselves travelling in the dark.</p>
<p>Road collisions involving teenagers typically occur on weekdays at peak travelling times when teenagers are going to and from school, between 07:00 and 09:00 and 15:00 and 19:00.</p>
<p>Chris Lines, Head of the London Road Safety Unit at Transport for London, said:&nbsp;'Our tireless efforts to highlight the issue of teen road safety have had a positive impact over the years. </p>

<p>'However, although awareness has risen people should not get complacent. </p>
<h2>Be visible on roads</h2>
<p>'Athough the dark winter months are coming to an end London's teenagers still need to be wary as they travel around the city. </p>

<p>'I urge all teenagers to make sure that they are visible on the roads, particularly when they travel in the dark as that is when they are most vulnerable.'</p>
<p>Posters for TfL's current teen road safety campaign 'Don't Let Your Friendship Die on the Road' can be seen across London now.<br></p>

<br><strong>Notes to editors</strong><strong></strong>
<ul>
<li>In March 2000 the Government announced a new national road safety strategy and casualty reduction targets for 2010 in 'Tomorrow's roads - safer for everyone'.&nbsp; The casualty reduction targets are to be achieved by 2010<br>They are:&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All KSIs reduced by 40 per cent<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pedestrian KSIs reduced by 40 per cent&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyclist KSIs reduced by 40 per cent<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Powered two wheeler KSIs reduced by 40 per cent<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child KSIs reduced by 50 per cent<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All slight injuries reduced by 10 per cent </li>
<li>In addition, a Road Safety Plan for London was produced by TfL in 2006, which supported the national targets and set further targets for reducing the numbers of pedestrians, pedal cyclists and powered two-wheeler riders killed or seriously injured by 2010 against the same baseline<br>They are:&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All KSIs reduced by 50 per cent&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; People KSIs reduced by 50 per cent&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cyclist KSIs reduced by 50 per cent&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P2W KSIs reduced by 40<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Child KSIs reduced by 60 per cent&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All slight injuries reduced by 25 per cent<br> &nbsp;London has already exceeded the 2010 targets set by the Government for the number of children killed or seriously injured and the total number of people killed or seriously injured three years early.&nbsp;London has also met the more stringent London target of 60 per cent reduction in the number of children (age 15 years and younger) killed or seriously injured and is working to further reduce the number of casualties </li>
