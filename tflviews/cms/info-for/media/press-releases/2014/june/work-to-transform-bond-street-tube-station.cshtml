        <ul>
            <li>Central line passengers can get to and from the West End via Bond Street station</li>
            <li>Part of over &pound;10 billion continuous improvement of London Underground services</li>
            <li>Key West End station will be hugely enlarged to accommodate more shoppers and businesses from 2017</li>
            <li>Modernised station will provide interchange with Crossrail to cope with an increase of passengers to nearly a quarter of a million daily</li>
            <li>New escalators and new lifts will provide disabled passengers with step-free access from street to platform</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Work to enlarge Bond Street Underground station and make it step-free means that Jubilee line trains will not stop at Bond Street station from Monday 30 June until early December.</p>
        <p>Central line passengers have been able to get to the West End via Bond Street station since 18 June when the lift shaft enabling works affecting the Central line platforms were completed. </p>
        <p>The lift shaft will now continue to be constructed behind hoardings without affecting passengers.</p>
        <p>While work is being carried out to connect the new ticket hall to the existing station infrastructure, escalators will be inaccessible and Jubilee line trains will not be able to stop at Bond Street station.</p>
        <p>When Jubilee line trains are not stopping at Bond Street, passengers can use the Central line, or change to the Bakerloo line at Baker Street, or to the Victoria line at Green Park and travel to Oxford Circus. </p>
        <p>Alternatively, local buses to the Bond Street area are available from both Baker Street and Green Park.</p>
        <p>The redevelopment of Bond Street Underground station is part of London Underground's &pound;10 billion programme of continuous improvement. </p>
        <p>Major construction work will modernise and enlarge the station by 2017, allowing for the expected increase from 155,000 to 225,000 daily passengers at Bond Street station when Crossrail arrives the following year.</p>
        <p>The improvements are part of Transport for London's (TfL's) overall transport vision for the West End as it prepares to welcome more Tube customers and the arrival of Crossrail, with major expansion also taking place at Tottenham Court Road station. </p>
        <p>Customers will get their first look at brand new parts of Tottenham Court Road station by early 2015, when new access opens to the Northern line platforms. </p>
        <p>This includes a new entrance, with a second entrance opening later in 2015, a large part of the new ticket hall and escalators leading down to new pedestrian passages. </p>
        <p>Customers will also benefit from quicker and easier journeys as Bond Street station is radically improved, with a new ticket hall and a new station entrance on the north side of Oxford Street.</p>
        <p>New lifts will make the station step-free from street to platform, and new escalators are being fitted to handle the increasing number of customers who are using the station as we move toward the introduction of Crossrail.</p>
        <p>The modernised Tube station will interchange with the new Crossrail station, enabling customers to access the network via entrances on Hanover Square and Davies Street.</p>
        <p>Bond Street station will operate on an interchange and exit only basis from early December until the end of 2014 to facilitate further tunnelling works.</p>
        <p>David Waboso CBE, London Underground's Capital Programmes Director, said: </p>
        <p>'Bond Street station, at the heart of the West End, is already a major destination and passenger numbers will rise even further when Crossrail services begin. We're therefore transforming the Tube station &#45; with a new ticket hall, new entrance and step-free access amongst other improvements.</p>
        <p>'Central line trains are stopping at Bond Street station again, but in order to carry out this vital work Jubilee line trains will not be able to stop there between Monday 30 June and early December. I apologise for the inconvenience that this will cause, but unfortunately it's impossible to do this work solely during the few engineering hours when the Tube is closed. The end result will be a much bigger and better station for the hundreds of thousands of customers who use the station each day.'</p>
        <p>Richard Dickinson, CEO of New West End Company said, </p>
        <p>'As a key Underground station in London's West End, the improvements to Bond Street Tube station will provide one of the most important access routes to the area, further enhancing the visitor experience in what is one of the world's most renowned luxury shopping districts. TfL's plans for Crossrail provide a real opportunity for both shoppers and businesses in the area, and we're pleased to hear progress has been made so that the Central line will be open for shoppers and visitors for the summer months.'</p>
