            <p>Transport for London (TfL) advises all passengers to plan their journeys and to check before travelling to the Carnival, on Sunday and Bank Holiday Monday 27 and 28 August.</p>
<p>The key Tube lines serving the Carnival area, the Central and Hammersmith &amp; City lines, will run as normal with some extra services. But as part of TfL's &pound;10bn Investment Programme, a major increase in work is being carried out on the Tube at weekends and public holidays across London.</p>
<p>This work, being carried out by Metronet and Tube Lines, is essential to meet London's transport needs now, and in future. </p>
<p>But it means that some stations and sections of other lines across London will see some disruption.</p>
<p>TfL advises passengers to check before travelling via the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>The TfL website: <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tubeworks">www.tfl.gov.uk/tubeworks</a> 
</li><li>The London Travel Information 24- hour telephone helpline 020 7222 1234 
</li><li>BBC Ceefax, page 436, or ITV's Teletext, page 164 
</li><li>Information on posters, leaflets and "Good Service" boards at Tube stations</li></ul>
<p>Mike Brown, LU's Chief Operating Officer, said: "The Carnival is a massive annual event - the biggest of its kind in Europe - and we want everyone going to enjoy themselves. </p>
<p>"This year, as with every other, we at Transport for London are working with Carnival organisers to make sure we all enjoy another successful year. </p>
<p>"The easiest way to travel to the Carnival and back is by bus and Tube.</p>
<p>"But plan your journey, check before you travel, and be aware that crowds and road closures could slow you down.</p>
<p>"For safety reasons some stations may close temporarily if they become overcrowded.</p>
<p>"Travelling back may be easier from another station or bus stop, so check the options for your return journey before you go. </p>
<p>"Notting Hill Carnival leaflets with maps showing the Carnival route and providing helpful information are available from Tube stations."</p>
