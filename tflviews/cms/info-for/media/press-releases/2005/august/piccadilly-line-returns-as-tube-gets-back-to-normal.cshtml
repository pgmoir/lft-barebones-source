            <p>Since 7 July, the Piccadilly line has been suspended from Hyde Park Corner to Arnos Grove and between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge. </p>
<p>All LU stations are now being served. </p>
<p>Restoring Tube services to normal within the space of four weeks is a tremendous achievement and one that has been made possible by the incredible efforts from LU, Metronet and Tube Lines staff.</p>
<p>Tim O'Toole, LU Managing Director, said: "The return of the Piccadilly line is a major step as the Underground and London get back to normal. </p>
<p>"We are now serving all stations and are determined to get on with the job of transforming the Tube.</p>
<p>"I would like to pay tribute to the work of the staff from London Underground, Metronet and Tube Lines who have done an incredible job in the past few weeks. </p>
<p>"Not only did they perform magnificently on July 7 and 21, but they have enabled the Tube and London to get back to normal within four weeks.</p>
<p>"However, at this time, we also remember those who were killed or injured on 7 July. </p>
<p>"Our thoughts are with the families of the bereaved and with those still recovering. We will never forget them."</p>
<p>Tube Lines, responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, deserve great credit for helping restore the Piccadilly line so quickly. </p>
<p>
<h2>Track replacement works</h2>
<p>They have also used the Piccadilly line suspension between Arnos Grove and Hyde Park as an opportunity to advance ongoing station refurbishment works at Caledonian Road, Manor House and Turnpike Lane stations. 
<p>Similarly, Metronet did an excellent job restoring the lines at Aldgate and Edgware Road. 
<p>
<p>The work to transform the Tube continues. </p>
<p>This weekend, major planned track replacement works will take place from Acton Town to Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly line and Earl's Court to Acton Town on the District line. </p>
<p>This work cannot be delayed, if we are to meet our schedule in transforming the Tube. </p>
<p>More information on the planned engineering works will enable you to plan your journeys. </p>
