<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced &pound;2.5m for Islington to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.</p>
<p>The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>The &pound;2.5m funding package in 2013/14 in Islington will finance a range of transport projects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;531,000 to improve road safety and encourage walking and cycling in the Kings Cross area, covering Caledonian Road &amp; Barnsbury Rail Station in the north to the junction with Pentonville Road in the south.&nbsp;The scheme will improve east-west pedestrian and cycling connections between York Way and Caledonian Road</li>
<li>&pound;228,000 for road safety works on principal roads including St Paul's Road and the Tollington area to ensure pedestrians and cyclists and all road users cross easily and safely</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:&nbsp;'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Islington.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'</p>
<p>This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said:&nbsp;'We are working in partnership with Islington and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>Last year Islington's LIP programme funded 41 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 1,751 children and 741 adults, 38 road safety education events and 140 new street trees.</p>
<p>Notable larger projects undertaken in the borough this year include continued road safety schemes which received &pound;195,000 to target areas with high numbers of collisions. Locations include Hanley Road, Despard Road/Highgate Hill Junction and Tufnell Park Road.</p><strong>

</p>
<p>Notes to editors:</strong><p>
<p>Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While individual transport projects&nbsp;are the responsibility of each borough.</p>
