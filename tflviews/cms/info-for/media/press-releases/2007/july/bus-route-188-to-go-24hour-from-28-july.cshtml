<p>Transport for London has announced that from 28 July 2007, route 188, which runs from Russell Square to North Greenwich, will run for 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>The route will provide a half-hourly service throughout the night, seven days a week, improving night-time links from central London to Bermondsey, Canada Water and Greenwich.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It will also provide an all-night service between central London and North Greenwich, serving the new 02 arena. </p>
<p>John Barry, Head of Network Development for London Buses, said: 'The new 24-hour service on route 188 is another accessible transport connection for late-night travellers in the Capital.</p>
<p>'London's night bus network has expanded dramatically in recent years with passenger numbers more than doubling since 2000. Almost half the users are people travelling to or from work.'</p>
<p>The change comes following a review of the existing service.</p>
