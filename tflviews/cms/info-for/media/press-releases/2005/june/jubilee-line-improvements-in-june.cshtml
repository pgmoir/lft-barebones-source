        While the track is being replaced to improve the reliability and give a smoother ride on the Jubilee line, buses will replace Tube services between West Hampstead and Neasden on Saturday and Sunday 18 and 19 June 2005.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The Jubilee line will therefore be operating in two separate sections between Stratford and West Hampstead and between Neasden and Stanmore, while Tube Lines are carrying out the track replacement work.</p>
<p>The Metropolitan line will also be suspended south of Wembley Park on the same weekend.</p>
<p>Rail Replacement Bus Services</p>
<ul>
<li>Bus service 'A' Finchley Road to Willesden Green calling at all Jubilee line stations<br>
</li><li>Bus service 'B' Willesden Green to Wembley Park calling at Dollis Hill, but not Neasden Station<br>
</li><li>Bus service 'B' Non-stop Wembley Park to Stonebridge Park</li></ul>
<p>Additionally first and last buses on both 18 and 19 June will run to and from Baker Street due to the later start and earlier finish of Bakerloo line/Silverlink trains at Stonebridge Park.</p>
<p>London Underground tickets and passes will be valid on the local bus routes to reach alternative London Underground lines.</p>
<p>Passengers are advised to start their journeys at least 30 minutes earlier. </p>
