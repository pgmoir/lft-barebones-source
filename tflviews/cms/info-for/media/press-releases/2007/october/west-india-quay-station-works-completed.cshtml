<p>The &pound;1.85m works, which began in March 2007, were funded by Transport for London's &pound;10bn investment programme and completed three months ahead of schedule and on budget. </p>
<p>The station has had its previous canopy replaced with a new bright glass one, which is stronger, bigger, and easier to clean. </p>
<p>Ninety per cent of the glass, metal and general waste removed from the original canopy was recycled. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the central part of the canopy was constructed from recycled rubber and plastic.</p>
<p>A replacement canopy was required as a series of new developments in and around the station mean that it is now more susceptible to adverse weather conditions, such as high winds.</p>
<h2>High-profile projects </h2>

<p>Jonathan Fox, Director DLR, said: "I am particularly pleased to see this initiative successfully concluded ahead of time and on-budget. </p>
<p>"While the railway is involved in various high-profile projects such as the Woolwich Arsenal and Stratford International extensions, it is essential that we continue to upgrade our existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>"The work at West India Quay demonstrates this commitment to our customers, and I'm sure that all will be pleased with the improvements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;"DLR now handles well over 60m users a year and this work will ensure our service and facilities continue to keep pace with demand and expectation."</p>
