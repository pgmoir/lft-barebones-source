            <p>Londoners will find RMT strike threat 'hard to take'</p>
<p>London Underground (LU) today condemned the RMT leadership's threat of strike action and, once again, urged them to put a two-year, above inflation pay offer to their members, recommending that Tube staff accept a very fair and final offer.</p>
<p>LU has tabled a two-year offer to all unions which would see staff's pay increase by 1.5 per cent this year, and RPI+ 0.5 per cent - or 0.5 per cent, whichever is the greater - next year. </p>
<h2>Strike action</h2>
<p>Two unions have now put the offer to their members, with TSSA recommending the offer be accepted, and we are waiting to hear the results.&nbsp; </p>
<p>In contrast, the RMT's leadership has chosen to reject the offer and ballot for strike action.</p>
<p>Richard Parry, Managing Director of London Underground, said: 'Londoners will find another RMT leadership strike threat hard to take, especially when we are offering a two-year above inflation pay offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Many Londoners have seen their pay frozen or have lost their jobs this year.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Fair and final offer</h2>
<p>'In contrast, we are offering stability and security in one of the toughest economic climates in decades.</p>
<p>'Another strike will achieve nothing except lose staff more pay and cause unnecessary frustration and disruption to Londoners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'We urge all of our unions to put this very fair and final offer to their members and urge all Tube staff to accept it.'<br></p>
