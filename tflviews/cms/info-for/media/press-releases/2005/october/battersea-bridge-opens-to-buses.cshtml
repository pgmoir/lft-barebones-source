<p>The bridge remains closed to drivers of other vehicles for safety reasons until repairs can be made. </p>
<p>Some 1,300 vehicles usually use Battersea Bridge every hour at peak times and it cannot accommodate such volumes with just one lane.</p>
<p>Clear signage will be in place to remind drivers that for safety reasons, the bridge remains closed to general traffic and strict enforcement will be in place, with those who ignore the restrictions facing fines of up to &pound;100. </p>
<p>Drivers should continue using alternative routes and adjust the time allowed for their journeys.</p>
<p>Transport for London is working hard to complete its damage assessment and to commence repair of the bridge as soon as possible, and appreciates drivers' patience.<br></p>
