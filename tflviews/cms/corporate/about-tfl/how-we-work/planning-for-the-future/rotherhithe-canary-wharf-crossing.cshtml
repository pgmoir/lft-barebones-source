        We want to build a new river crossing for pedestrians and cyclists between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf. We're currently looking at options for a fast ferry service.

      <p>A new crossing would&nbsp;create a much needed route across the Thames in east London and benefit communities on both sides of the river.</p>

<p>It would link into nearby cycle routes and help encourage more people to walk and cycle in line with the Mayor's <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/healthy-streets">Healthy Streets Approach for London</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Options for a crossing</h2>

<p>We have worked with engineering consultants Arcadis and Knight Architects to review the need for a new crossing and explore different options to make sure the crossing chosen is value for money. We considered design and engineering issues and modelled demand for different crossings at this location, as well as speaking to local residents and stakeholders.</p>

<p>This work led to a shortlist of three options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Enhanced ferry service</li>
	<li>An opening bridge that opens to allow river traffic to navigate through it</li>
	<li>Tunnel</li>
</ul>

<p>These options were assessed on&nbsp;how well they met&nbsp;the scheme's objectives, likely costs, potential benefits and possible impact.</p>

<h2>Next steps</h2>

<p>So far, an opening&nbsp;bridge between Rotherhithe and Canary Wharf is our preferred option.&nbsp;But such a bridge in this place is complex and will cost more than we can afford right now, so we have decided to pause our work to develop a new bridge .</p>

<p>We're&nbsp;looking at options instead for&nbsp;a new fast ferry service. Along with our wider investment in new cycling facilities in this part of London, this would let more people&nbsp;choose walking and cycling and&nbsp;support new homes and jobs in the area</p>

<p>Our work to develop proposals for a bridge has given us&nbsp;a high quality design, detailed procedures for how it would operate and plans for how it could be built in the future. We will keep this under review and update everyone once our proposals for a ferry service have moved ahead.</p>

<h2>Mayor's Transport Strategy</h2>

<p>A new river crossing would give thousands of people a direct, above ground link between Canada Water and Canary Wharf..</p>

<p>This proposal is part of the Mayor's wider package of river crossings and new walking and cycling infrastructure in east London that was set out in his Manifesto and <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/the-mayors-transport-strategy">the Mayor's Transport Strategy</a>.</p>

<h2>Consultation</h2>

<p>Londoners gave their views on all the&nbsp;options,&nbsp;as well as other decisions such as where to put an opening bridge,&nbsp;during our public consultation in late 2017/early 2018. The consultation report and our response to the issues raised are on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/rivercrossings/rotherhithe-canarywharf/?cid=r2cw-crossing">Rotherhithe-Canary Wharf crossing consultation page</a>.</p>
