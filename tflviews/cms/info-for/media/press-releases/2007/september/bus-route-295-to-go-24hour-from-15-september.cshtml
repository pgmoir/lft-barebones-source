<p>The route will provide a half-hourly service throughout the night, seven days a week. It will improve night-time links from Ladbroke Grove to Shepherd's Bush, Hammersmith and Clapham Junction.</p>
<p>John Barry, Head of Network Development for London Buses, said: "The new 24-hour service on route 295 is another accessible transport connection for late-night travellers in the Capital.</p>
<p>"London's night bus network has expanded dramatically in recent years with passenger numbers more than doubling since 2000. Almost half the users are people travelling to or from work."</p>
<p>The change comes following a review of the existing service.
