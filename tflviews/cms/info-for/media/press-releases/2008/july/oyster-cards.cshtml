<p>A Transport for London spokesperson said:</p>
<p>"There was a technical problem with Oyster card readers at London Underground stations this morning which affected Oyster pay as you go cards only.&nbsp; Oyster card readers on the bus and tram network were unaffected. </p>

<p>"The problem has now been resolved and card readers are progressively coming back on-line at London Underground stations. </p>

<p>"Cards have not been disabled and so can continue to be used as normal.&nbsp; We will automatically refund any passengers who may have been charged the maximum &pound;4 fare as a result of not being able to touch in and out at the beginning and end of their journeys this morning. Oyster card holders need take no further action.</p>

<p>"This problem, like the recent issue, resulted from incorrect data tables being sent out by our contractor, Transys (a consortium of the firms EDS and Cubic).&nbsp; Transys has also issued a statement today confirming that they are taking steps to ensure that this does not happen again, that they will undertake a root cause analysis and, like us, apologising for any inconvenience caused to our customers."<br></p>
