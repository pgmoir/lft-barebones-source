        Cycleway 9 (previously Cycle Superhighway 9) will make cycling and walking easier, safer, and more appealing on roads in west Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick and Brentford town centre. Construction at Kew Bridge junction will finish in November 2020 - the full scheme will be completed by summer 2022.

      <p>Find out how to get around the Kew Bridge area during the first phase of construction on the <a href="/status-updates/major-works-and-events/cycleway-9">Cycleway 9 travel advice page</a>.</p>

<p>We consulted on our plans in autumn 2017. An updated consultation report and our response to the issues raised during is now available on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/cs9/?cid=cs9">Cycle Superhighway 9 consultation page</a>.</p>

<p>We consulted on two parts of the route in early&nbsp;2019:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kew Bridge and Kew Bridge Road to Wellesley Road</li>
	<li>Duke Road and Duke's Avenue's junction with Chiswick High Road</li>
</ul>

<p>Our consultation report and response to issues raised during this consultation are on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/roads/kew-duke/?cid=kew-duke">Kew Bridge/Duke Road consultation page</a>.</p>

<h2>Why we're building Cycleway 9</h2>

<p>The new cycle route will be clearer and safer&nbsp;for cyclists in west London, largely separating them from other vehicles.</p>

<p>The route, between Kensington Olympia and Brentford, connects town centres in west London through Hammersmith and Chiswick. It will link important amenities and facilities and make the areas more pleasant to live, work and spend time in.</p>

<p>The changes will also make it easier for pedestrians to cross busy roads and remove through traffic on some residential roads.</p>

<h2>Cycle network</h2>

<p>Cycle routes like Cycleway 9 help to support the <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/the-mayors-transport-strategy">Mayor's Transport Strategy</a> and <a href="/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/healthy-streets">Healthy Streets Approach</a> by encouraging walking, cycling and using public transport.</p>

<p>The proposed changes between Kensington Olympia and Brentford town centre include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A two-way segregated cycle track on Hammersmith Road, King Street and Chiswick High Road</li>
	<li>Five new signal-controlled pedestrian crossings and more than 20 upgraded pedestrian crossings</li>
	<li>Reducing through traffic and rat-running in residential roads by restricting access to the South Circular from Wellesley Road and Stile Hall Gardens for motor vehicles, making these streets more appealing places to walk and cycle</li>
	<li>Stepped cycle tracks (at a lower height than the footway) in each direction on Brentford High Street; eastbound stepped track on Kew Bridge Road, westbound cycle path through Waterman's Park</li>
	<li>Changes to bus stop locations and layouts, including new bus stop bypasses for cyclists</li>
	<li>Changes to parking and loading bays and hours of operation</li>
</ul>

<p>This section of Cycleway 9 would provide a continuous, largely-segregated route between Kensington Olympia and Brentford town centre, via Hammersmith and Chiswick.</p>

<h3>Change of name</h3>

<p>We have changed the name of this route from Cycle Superhighway 9 to Cycleway 9. Cycle Superhighways and Quietways are being combined into one cycle network called '<a href="/modes/cycling/routes-and-maps/cycleways">Cycleways</a>'.</p>

<h2>Extension to Hounslow</h2>

<p>We are working closely with the London Borough of Hounslow to develop proposals to extend Cycleway 9 further west through Brentford and towards Hounslow.</p>
