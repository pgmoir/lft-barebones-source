<p>The Blackwall Tunnel northbound will reopen at 19.00 tonight (Monday 30 November) after TfL engineers worked quickly to repair fire damage to the tunnel.</p>
<p>Garrett Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer, London Streets, said: 'I would like to pay tribute to the tireless work of the emergency services, tunnel engineers and many others who have ensured we have been able to reopen the tunnel so quickly.</p>

<p>'I'm delighted that we will be able to reopen it this evening.</p>
<p>'We took a number of steps to mitigate the disruption and frustration to people travelling in the area.&nbsp; Thankfully things will now be able to return to normal.'</p>

<p>The fire, involving a people carrier, happened at around 17.45 on Sunday 29 November.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Congestion Charge cameras in the area east of City Road and Blackfriars Road, which were turned off while the tunnel was closed, will be reinstated.<br></p>
