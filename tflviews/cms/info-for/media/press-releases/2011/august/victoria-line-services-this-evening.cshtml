            <p>Services are currently suspended between Seven Sisters and Highbury &amp; Islington, with significant disruption across the rest of the line, and TfL&nbsp;is pressing contractors Bombardier and Invensys to resolve the issues as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Although engineers are working flat out to restore full services, it is likely that disruption will persist throughout the evening. </p>
<p>TfL is dedicating all available resources to managing the situation, and is dispatching a fleet of rail replacement buses to help supplement the bus services that currently serve the affected areas. </p>
<h2>Fares refunded</h2>
<p>All Victoria line passengers on Oyster pay as you go who are affected by the disruption will have their fares automatically refunded. </p>
<p>The refunds will be applied automatically when passengers travel through the gate line as usual at their regular station within the next couple of days.</p>

<p>Any passengers who travelled with paper tickets and were affected can <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tfl/tickets/refunds/tuberefund">apply for a refund</a>.</p>

<p>The teething problems with the signalling today have arisen following weekend upgrade works on the line's system. </p>

<p>The new signalling, when fully operational, will mean a 21 per cent increase in capacity, or space for an extra 10,000 journeys per hour.</p>
<h2>Minimising disruption</h2>
<p>Mike Brown, London Underground's&nbsp;Managing Director, said: 'I apologise to passengers for the disruption on the Victoria line today and assure them that we are doing everything possible to resolve the issue and minimise the disruption as they travel home.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'I'm very disappointed that our contractors have failed today to deliver the reliable service that our passengers deserve, and we are pressing both Invensys and Bombardier to take every measure to ensure this situation is not repeated.'</p>
<p>Passengers should check before they travel by visiting <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk">www.tfl.gov.uk</a><br></p>
