            <p><!-- #EndEditable -->Despite London Underground's (LU's) demands, Metronet will not complete the modernisation and lift replacement works by the end of May 2006 as promised.</p>
<p>Queensway station has been closed for more than one year to allow Metronet Rail BCV to replace lifts, undertake congestion relief work and refurbish the station. </p>
<p>The station is now due to re-open around four weeks after the original contract completion date of May 9, 2006.</p>
<p>TfL Commissioner, Peter Hendy demanded that Metronet's five shareholders - Atkins, Balfour Beatty, Bombardier Transportation, EDF Energy and Thames Water - improve the company's performance, or risk further damaging their reputation following a series of recent failures by Metronet.</p>
<p>Tim O'Toole, LU Managing Director said: 'This is another example of poor planning, management and execution of work by Metronet. They have had a year to complete the modernisation and lift replacement work at Queensway, but have failed to do so on time. </p>
<p>'TfL is investing &pound;10bn to improve London's transport now and for the future, with more than half of that in the Tube. </p>
<p>'To bring passengers with us, they need the confidence that this work can be completed on time and on budget.'</p>
<p>LU continues to press Metronet to complete the works and reopen the station at the earliest possible date. </p>
<p>LU will continue to keep customers informed of progress and the station's opening.<br></p>
<p>
            <ul>
<li>Metronet BCV are responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria and Waterloo & City lines</li>
<li>TfL is investing &pound;10bn over the next five years to improve and expand London's transport network, more than half of that in LU as we work to Transform the Tube</li>
<li>Approximately 8,500 customers use Queensway station each weekday<br></li></ul>
