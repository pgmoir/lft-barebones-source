<p>TGB Project Manager Michael Clarke said: <br>"This is another positive step forward for the Thames Gateway Bridge project. Approval of the planning application by December this year would enable us to achieve an earlier opening date of 2012." </p>
<p>Powers from Central Government and other agencies are also required to build the Bridge and TfL will make these applications over the next few weeks. This follows approval of the project by the TfL Board and the announcement of in principle support from Government earlier this year.</p>
