            <li>More information available at

        <p>With less than a month to go until the world's largest annual
        sporting event comes to the City of London, Transport for London (TfL) is
        holding a local information session to keep Londoners informed about the event.</p>
        <p>The iconic Tour de France will roll onto the streets of London on
        Monday 7 July bringing out hundreds of thousands of Londoners and visitors to
        see this spectacle.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>On
        the day, a large number of road closures around the route will be in place so
        people are advised to plan their travel in advance. </p>
        <p>Road closures for the event will begin after the morning peak at
        10:00, with roads reopening as quickly as possible once the Tour has passed
        through and it is safe to do so. TfL anticipates that all roads will be
        reopened by 18:00. P</p>
        <p>edestrians will be able to cross the route at key crossing
        points and we are working with local businesses close to the route to
        ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum.
        &nbsp;
        The
        A1211, which includes London Wall, will remain open all day, although it will
        be busier than normal. Tower, Southwark and
        Westminster Bridges will be closed for much of the day but there are no planned
        closures on any other major river crossings in central London.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>An
        extensive programme of public engagement&nbsp;and communication around the
        arrival of the Tour de France in the capital is now underway similar to that
        developed during the London 2012 Olympics, to help businesses and the public plan and get
        around on the day and make the most of the return of the prestigious event.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        Londoners in the City are invited to attend a public information
        session at the City Marketing Suite (within the Guildhall Complex)
        on 26 June between 16:00 and 19:00. This will allow
        members of the community to talk through the event and its impact on the local
        area with representatives from TfL.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The City of London will be a great place to
        see the world's best riders as they pass sights such as St Paul's Cathedral,
        the Tower of London and the Monument. </p>
        <p>Despite the road closures the City will
        be, as ever, well and truly open for business, and people are encouraged to
        enjoy the atmosphere provided by the riders and the publicity caravanne.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The Tour de
        France &#45; the world's largest annual sporting event &#45; comes to London on Monday 7
        July after the first two stages in Yorkshire. Around 200 elite cyclists will
        travel from Cambridge, through Essex, into London through Epping Forest before
        a spectacular finish on The Mall.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The Tour de
        France will draw people onto the streets of London from near and far, and help
        to inspire more people to take up cycling. </p>
        <p>Hosting world renowned events such
        as the Tour reinforces London's reputation as a world-class host of cultural,
        sporting and business events. </p>
        <p>Visitors, both domestic and overseas, are brought
        to the capital by major events, delivering direct and indirect economic
        benefits, and showcasing London to a much wider audience.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>arrett Emmerson,
        Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport at TfL, said: &quot;We've been working long and hard to plan
        for this great event's return to the capital and now we are asking Londoners to
        start their planning too.
        &nbsp;
        "We will keep the capital moving, and roads around the race
        route will, of course, be extremely busy.&nbsp; So we're asking people to plan
        ahead and preferably use public transport to make the most of what I'm sure
        will be an amazing day that will help cement London's growing reputation as a
        major cycling city and encourage more Londoners to travel by bike.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Bus
        services around the route will be affected. Routes 15, 42, 78, 100, 344 and RV1
        which pass through the City will be affected by road closures. Some stops may
        also be temporarily relocated or suspended.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Full
        details of road closures are available at <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance">tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Drivers are urged to plan ahead or to consider re-timing their journey to avoid
        disruption, particularly if people are planning to travel to or from airports
        or to a special event.
        &nbsp;

            Marketing Suite: (within the Guildhall Complex) at 80 Basinghall Street,
            EC2V 5AR</li>
            <li>The
            detailed Tour de France route is available on the TfL website at
            tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance. </li>
            <li>To avoid delays drivers are advised to, wherever
            possible, avoid areas&nbsp;near the event routes in the affected parts of
            Cambridgeshire, Essex and London. For up to date information on how transport
            services are operating, check before you travel at tfl.gov.uk and follow
            &#64;TfLTravelAlerts (Tube, DLR and London Overground), &#64;TfLTrafficNews (roads) and
            &#64;TfLBusAlerts (bus).
            &nbsp;
            Tube
            and Rail will be the best way to get around the affected areas of London,
            with the vast majority of services in central London running as normal.
            The Circle and District lines are expected to be extremely busy as will
            stations along the route, particularly in Zone 1 from midday until around
            18:00</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France will kick off a spectacular summer of cycling in London, with
            the exciting event followed by Prudential RideLondon on the 9 and 10 August and
            then the Tour of Britain, which finishes in the capital on 14 September</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France is the world's largest annual sporting event and covers
            approximately 3,500kms. A worldwide television audience of 3.5billion people
            watch the event annually. There will be 190 countries broadcasting the Tour de
            France and there are 5,000 hours of TV coverage annually. The last time the
            Tour visited England was in 2007 when London hosted the Grand D&eacute;part,
            which is the opening of the race</li>
            <li>This
            summer's cycling events are likely to inspire thousands more Londoners to take
            to two wheels, building on the Mayor's ambition for cycling to be an integral
            part of the transport network. As part of his cycling vision, the Mayor is
            already engaging in a vast &pound;1billion programme of improvements&nbsp; - creating
            a series of enhanced cycling superhighways, urban 'quietways' for more cautious
            cyclists, and turning some outer boroughs into mini-Hollands</li>
            <li>For
            more information on the Mayor's Vision for Cycling visit <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/vision-for-cycling">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/vision-for-cycling</a></li>
            <li>The
            Mayor is committed to ensuring London retains its status as the world capital
            of sport, and has recently set up the Major Events Oversight Board. The board
            is chaired by Sir Edward Lister, and comprises of TfL, the emergency services
            and other key partner agencies. It provides strategic direction and advice to
            the Mayor on the approach to bidding, staging and evaluating major events in
            London. The board ensures that all major road events continue to be carefully
            considered and tightly managed to ensure everyone gets full benefit from the
            event without undue impact on Londoners and London's transport. The board also
            looks at ways to ensure the major events programme is effectively communicated
            with Londoners, visitors, businesses and stakeholders to allow sufficient
            notice and forward planning for everyone.
