<p>Transport for London (TfL) is encouraging the public to give their views on proposals for Crossrail 2, as the consultation on the transformative railway for London and the South East enters its final month.</p>
<p>Launched by TfL and Network Rail in October, the latest public consultation on the proposed new railway closes on Friday 8 January 2016.  It has already attracted thousands of responses, with many people attending the public consultation local drop-in events all along the route from Surrey to Hertfordshire, with over 70 events organised. ‎</p>
<p>The consultation provides the latest plans reflecting comments from earlier consultations. It includes proposals for:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Station locations, entrances and exits for the tunnelled section of the route</li>
    <li>Locations of ventilation shafts for the tunnelled section</li>
    <li>Construction sites required to build the scheme; and</li>
    <li>Service patterns and changes to existing National Rail services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Crossrail 2 will connect National Rail networks in Surrey and Hertfordshire with an underground tunnelled section crossing beneath central London between Wimbledon and Tottenham Hale and New Southgate. It will enable 270,000 more people to enter central London every morning at peak time helping relieve the increasing pressure on London's transport network. The railway will also drive the development of 200,000 homes and 200,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>The project has gathered pace significantly over the Autumn. As part of the Government's Spending Review, the Chancellor has confirmed a new &pound;300 million Transport Development Fund for the next generation of transport infrastructure projects including Crossrail 2, which is being considered by the newly created National Infrastructure Commission. This is expected to report in spring 2016.</p>
<p>Responses from the public consultation will help shape the proposals for the scheme. Subject to further development and consultation, TfL and Network Rail will then seek powers for permission to build and operate Crossrail 2. With Government funding and approval, construction could begin in 2020 with the first Crossrail 2 service running in 2030.</p>
<p>TfL and Network Rail have held an extensive series of 'drop-in' events along the proposed route throughout November and early December with staff on hand to explain our proposals and answer questions. Thousands of people have already attended these events with many still scheduled across London until Friday 18 December. More information on these events can be found on the Crossrail 2 website.</p>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson MP, said: `Crossrail 2 will be a transformative new transport link that will significantly improve capacity on the rail network into and out of London thereby boosting jobs, new homes and economic growth in the Capital and far beyond. Crossrail 2 is a major infrastructure project and so it's vital that we get it right from the start. This consultation is key to helping us to shape the proposals and to ensure that everyone with a view on Crossrail 2 can have their say and is listened to. We know that there's massive support for Crossrail 2 but we need to get the scheme right to ensure that there is real momentum behind our efforts to get it delivered.'</p>
<p>Mich&egrave;le Dix, TfL's Managing Director for Crossrail 2, said: `Crossrail 2 is a vital new railway to meet the growing demands of the rapidly growing population of London and the South East, and help support thousands of new homes and jobs across the region, whilst boosting the UK economy.</p>
<p>`Receiving and listening to the public's feedback on our latest proposals is an important part of our plans to develop Crossrail 2. It's been helpful to understand people's concerns as well as receive their support. We have really appreciated that so many people have come to the drop-in events.  We have already had a large number of responses to the consultation and I would encourage others to read about our proposals and give us their views before the consultation closes in January.'</p>
<p>Chris Curtis, Network Rail's Head of Crossrail 2, said: `Crossrail 2 would deliver vital extra capacity to the National Rail network and provide new and improved regional connections across London and beyond.</p>
<p>`This consultation is a great opportunity for rail passengers to have their say on what Crossrail 2 would mean for the proposed train services in north east London, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire, south west London, Surrey and Hampshire. I'd urge anyone who wants to see a better rail service for their area to get involved over the next few weeks.'</p>
<p>The public can give their views on any aspect of the proposals at <a href="http://www.crossrail2.co.uk">www.crossrail2.co.uk</a> until Friday 8 January 2016. Factsheets, maps and further information on the scheme can also be found online. A consultation report on the responses received will be published in spring 2016.</p>
