            <p>Tower Hill station will continue to operate as normal during this time.</p>
<p>Customers may notice temporary Portakabins and hoardings. </p>
<p>The work will be undertaken by Metronet Rail SSL, who will take advantage of track improvement works and the suspension of services between Earl's Court and Whitechapel to close the station fully on November 19-20 and 26-27.</p>
<p>It is likely that they will use any future Earl's Court to Whitechapel track works to again close the station to accelerate the improvements.</p>
<p><strong>The refurbishment works will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Replacement of CCTV cameras</li>
<li>Installation of customer help points</li>
<li>An enhanced public address system</li>
<li>New wall tiles</li>
<li>Improved lighting and ceilings</li>
<li>Tactile strips on platforms and stairs, along with contrasting handrails</li></ul>
<p>The station will benefit from improved ambience, safety and security once the work is completed.</p>
