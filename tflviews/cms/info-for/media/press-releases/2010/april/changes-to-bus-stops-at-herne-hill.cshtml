<p>From Saturday 17 April Lambeth Council are introducing a junction improvement scheme at Herne Hill which will mean some changes to bus stops in the area.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Routes 3, 196, 201, 322, 690 and N3, which currently use stop A outside Herne Hill Station will have new stopping arrangements due to the&nbsp; pedestrianisation of the southern stretch of Railton Road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Southbound buses on these routes will now use stop N on Dulwich Road instead. Northbound buses on the affected routes will continue to use their existing stops (L and M) outside Brockwell Park on Dulwich Road.</p>
<p>A new northbound stop is being introduced on Norwood Road. This will be served by routes 68, 468 and N68.<br></p>
