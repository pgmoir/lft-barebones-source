        LU operates over a third of service, now on 9 of 11 lines, with around 70 per cent of stations open
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Nearly nine in 10 (86 per cent) regular Oyster customers had travelled on Tube, rail, bus, DLR and London Overground services in the capital by early evening, despite the unnecessary strike action called by the leaderships of the RMT and TSSA unions, TfL said today.</p>
<p>London Underground (LU) has operated over a third (35 per cent) of services, with around 70 per cent of Tube stations open.  </p>
<p>A service on the Bakerloo line from Queen's Park to Elephant &amp; Castle was introduced for this evening's peak.  </p>
<p>Alongside the range of other transport options and hundreds of TfL Ambassadors and volunteers, TfL said the figures showed that the vast majority of Londoners are getting around the capital and it was keeping London moving and open for business.</p>
<p>The strikes have been called by the leadership of the RMT and TSSA unions over LU's plans to modernise and improve customer service.  </p>
<p>LU Managing Director, Mike Brown has made the following commitments to Londoners:</p>
<p>All stations will remain staffed and controlled at all times, with more staff visible to help customers</p>
<ul>
    <li>We'll introduce a new 24-hour service at weekends from 2015 </li>
    <li>We'll provide more frequent and reliable services with better, more accessible stations </li>
    <li>We'll introduce simpler ticketing - such as contactless credit, debit and charge card payment </li>
    <li>We'll provide the best possible value for the fare you pay</li>
</ul>
<p>Mike Brown said today:<br />`Many thousands of LU and TfL staff are working hard to keep customers informed and to keep London moving and open for business today.  </p>
<p>`I am grateful to everyone who has offered their support today and to our customers for their patience.  </p>
<p>`Nearly nine in ten Oyster customers have travelled and we're running over a third of normal Tube services, serving around 70 per cent of stations.</p>
<p>`My message to the leadership of the RMT and TSSA is that they should do the right thing, call off this completely unnecessary strike and work with us to help shape the future of the Tube.<br /> <br />`Our plans will see all Tube stations will remain staffed and controlled at all times when services are operating, and we'll be introducing a 24-hour service at weekends during 2015. </p>
<p>`In future, there will be more staff in ticket halls and on platforms to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys and to keep them safe and secure.<br /> <br />`We're committed to implement these changes without compulsory redundancies and there'll be a job for everyone at LU who wants to work for us and be flexible.'<br /> <br />Latest Travel advice to customers (16:00):<br />The situation may change throughout the day and buses and the transport network will be very busy. </p>
<p>TfL is urging all customers to plan ahead and to check before they travel at tfl.gov.uk and by following &#64;TfLTravelAlerts, &#64;TfLTrafficNews and &#64;TfLBusAlerts on Twitter.  </p>
<p>Visits to the Live Travel Information pages of the TfL website was eight times busier than normal this morning, as customers heeded the advice to plan ahead.<br /> <br />London Underground<br />Services are currently operating as follows:<br /><br /> </p>
