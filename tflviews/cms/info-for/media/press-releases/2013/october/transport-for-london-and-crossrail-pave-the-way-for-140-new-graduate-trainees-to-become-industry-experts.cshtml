<li>2014 TfL and Crossrail graduate trainee applications have opened</li></ul>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) and Crossrail have welcomed 140 new graduate trainees into their organisations. </p>
<p>The graduate trainees will work in areas including engineering, project management, transport planning, commercial, information management, finance and marketing roles. </p>
<p>Applications for the 2014 schemes have now opened and a similar number of graduates are expected to be recruited.</p>
<p>TfL is responsible for 27 million journeys a day. It operates the Tube network, London's strategic road network, buses, DLR, Trams, Barclays Cycle Hire, the Emirates Air Line and also licences passenger services on the river. </p>
<p>It is currently undertaking a multi billon pound transport investment programme that is delivering a faster, more efficient and comprehensive transport network for a growing population and to do so it needs a highly skilled workforce for now and in the future.</p>
<p>Depending on the scheme they are on, TfL graduates will spend up to three years as trainees working on projects such as the Bank Station upgrade, Barclays Cycle Hire, the Northern Line Extension and London Overground amongst many other TfL projects and services. </p>
<p>Projects that they will be working on include contributing to the improvement of the reliability of the Tube and to making TfL's network more accessible for passengers. </p>
<p>All TfL graduate trainees will also spend time in frontline roles across TfL's network to get a first-hand experience of providing Tube, Bus, rail and other services to customers. </p>
<p>Crossrail is Europe's largest construction project and will transform rail travel in London and the South East when it opens in 2018. </p>
<p>The Crossrail Graduate Scheme will offer graduates the opportunity to work alongside project management teams, contractors and designers delivering the Crossrail project. </p>
<p>Successful applicants recruited from courses in a range of engineering and commercial disciplines will join a two-year programme.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, said: 'Our transport network is currently moving a record number of passengers each year, and to upgrade and improve the services we deliver, we need highly skilled staff. </p>
<p>'Our graduate trainees will have the opportunity to work on different projects across our organisation to give them a real sense of what it takes to support 27 million journeys every day. </p>
<p>'I started as a graduate trainee in 1975 so I know that we can offer a long and fulfilling career with world class training.'</p>
<p>Crossrail's Chief Executive, Andrew Wolstenholme said: 'Crossrail will transform rail travel in London and the South East. This is a fantastic opportunity for graduates to join and play a key role in delivering Europe's largest construction project. </p>
<p>'The scheme is a great chance for graduates to work alongside world class contractors, designers and engineers and gain invaluable experience as they begin their careers.'</p>
<p>Transport for London Civil Engineer Graduate Trainee, Jonathan King, said: 'I've always wanted to work on major infrastructure projects and towards the end of my four year Architecture and Structural Engineering degree, I came across the TfL Civil Engineer Graduate Trainee scheme and decided to apply. I was delighted when I found out that I'd been successful.</p>
<p>'I've now been on my scheme for&nbsp;two years and have had the opportunity to work on some amazing projects such as the Olympic Route Network and the Bond Street station upgrade. </p>
<p>'I'm currently working on the expansion of Barclays Cycle Hire to southwest London and I'm really enjoying it. </p>
<p>'Being able to move across different parts of the organisation has given me the opportunity to see the depth of work it takes to move millions of people around London every day. </p>
<p>'TfL's graduate scheme has been fantastic and I would recommend any of their schemes to people considering a future in transport.'</p>
<p>TfL and Crossrail are committed to developing and maintaining the skills and talents of their workforce. </p>
<p>The two organisations currently employ over 28,000 employees directly and support 49,000 jobs outside London and 20,000 jobs in London through their supply chains. </p>
<p>Many of these roles are in highly skilled disciplines and TfL and Crossrail have a vital role to play in ensuring these skills are maintained and developed into the future. </p>
<p>It is estimated that Crossrail will generate at least 75,000 business opportunities and support the equivalent of 55,000 full time jobs right around the UK. </p>
<p>Three out of five businesses currently winning work on the project are based outside London and over half (58 per cent) are small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>
<p>Within the last three financial years 265 graduate roles have been created by TfL, with 130 enrolling in September 2013.&nbsp; </p>
<p>TfL is also a supporter of the Track and Train scheme which Network Rail launched last year (2012). The scheme supports the next generation of industry experts. </p>
<p>The scheme is supporting 50 positions this year based on 18-months paid placements. The scheme targets young people who have graduated in the last two years and have not been able to find a job in their local area. </p>
<p>Since April 2012, TfL has hosted placements for 13 Track and Train graduates with five of them receiving TfL permanent job offers.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Between April 2013 and October 2014, TfL will take on an additional three Track and Train graduates.</p>
<p>Graduates can apply for the 2014 TfL roles here <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/graduates">www.tfl.gov.uk/graduates</a>. Assessment centres will commence in November and successful applicants will start next September. </p>
<p>Since 2007, TfL has consistently appeared in the Graduate Times 100 list for best companies to work for, as voted by graduates. </p>
<p>TfL was also named the Graduate Employer of Choice in the Transport and Logistics sector in 2013.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Crossrail graduate scheme is now open to applications at <a href="http://www.crossrail.co.uk/graduates">www.crossrail.co.uk/graduates</a>. Successful applicants will start in September 2014.</p>
