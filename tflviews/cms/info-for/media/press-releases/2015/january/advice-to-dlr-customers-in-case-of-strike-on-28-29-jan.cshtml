        Strike by members of the RMT union in a dispute with KeolisAmey Docklands means DLR services unlikely to run on these days
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<ul>
    <li>Enhanced bus services to operate on key routes along the DLR network and a replacement bus service will connect DLR customers to the Tube network</li>
    <li>All other TfL services will operate as usual. These services expected to be busier than usual, so customers who have flexibility are advised to avoid the busiest times if they can</li>
    <li>Check <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk">www.tfl.gov.uk</a> for the latest information</li>
</ul>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) has today advised DLR customers to check the TfL website for the latest information about planned strike action by the RMT union, which would affect services on Wednesday 28 January and Thursday 29 January.</p>
<p>The planned strike is the result of a dispute between the RMT and KeolisAmey Docklands, which operates the DLR on behalf of TfL, over the outsourcing of maintenance work.</p>
<p>It is scheduled to take place between 4:00am on Wednesday 28 January and 3.59am on Friday 30 January. It is unlikely that any DLR services will operate during these times if the strike goes ahead. Services should operate as normal on Friday. All other TfL services which connect to the DLR network will be operating as usual.</p>
<p>Enhanced bus services will operate on key routes along the DLR network and there will also be replacement bus services to connect DLR customers to the Tube network.</p>
<p>TfL is calling on the RMT not to subject customers to disruption and to continue discussions with KeolisAmey Docklands to settle the dispute.</p>
<p>Rory O'Neill, TfL's Director of DLR, said: `If the strike goes ahead, KeolisAmey Docklands say that it is unlikely that any DLR services will run.  TfL bus, Tube and rail services will be operating as normal, extra buses will run on key routes and staff will be available to help. Customers are advised to use our website to plan ahead. As other TfL services are likely to be busier than normal, as ever, we ask customers who are able to consider avoiding the busiest times if they can.</p>
<p>Should the strike go ahead, the replacement bus service to connect DLR customers to the Tube will operate as below:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Beckton and Canning Town</li>
    <li>Canning Town, King George V and London City Airport</li>
    <li>Lewisham and North Greenwich via Greenwich Town centre</li>
</ul>
<p>TfL staff will also be on hand to provide travel information and advice. Customers wishing to travel to London City Airport are advised to the take either the replacement bus service from Canning Town, TfL bus services or a taxi.</p>
<p>Customers are also reminded that as part of Network Rail's rebuild of London Bridge mainline rail station, Southeastern services to and from Charing Cross are not calling at London Bridge and Thameslink services to that station are running a limited service.</p>
<p>Customers can keep up-to-date on the status of their services in a range of ways,  including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Up-to-date information on the TfL website at www.tfl.gov.uk</li>
    <li>Travel alerts will be provided through Twitter on &#64;TfL, &#64;TfLTravelAlerts and &#64;LondonDLR &#45; look out for #dlrstrike;</li>
    <li>
    TfL will also be providing information to radio and television broadcasts for use in news bulletins.</li>
</ul>
<p>ENDS</p>
<p>Notes to Editors:</p>
<p>If the strike goes ahead customers are asked to remember:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Oyster pay as you go is accepted for almost all National Rail journeys within Greater London;<br />
    Travelcards are also valid for travel on National Rail within the zones purchased;</li>
    <li>Pay as you go with an Oyster or contactless payments can be made on all TfL services;</li>
    <li>Travelcard season tickets will be accepted on the Emirates Air Line cable car in both directions. Opening times will be extended to from 6am to 11pm. The service may be disrupted when very strong wind conditions occur. </li>
    <li>Please check the TfL website, Twitter or our 24-hour travel information line on 0343 222 1234 (TfL call charges)</li>
</ul>
<p>Customers are advised that the following will apply:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Single/return printed tickets valid on DLR services issued on the day are bought at the customer's risk and will not be reimbursed</li>
    <li>These single/return printed tickets will be accepted on bus services (reasonable routes only) to allow people to complete their journeys</li>
    <li>They will not be valid on National Rail (NR) services. Customers wishing to use alternative NR services must buy a valid NR ticket</li>
    <li>Travelcard season tickets will be accepted on alternative services within their zonal validity, as normal. Customers travelling outside their zones will be charged a pay as you go fare. This will not be refunded</li>
    <li>Day Travelcards bought in advance may be refunded if surrendered before the day of validity - otherwise no refunds will be given</li>
    <li>PAYG users will be charged the appropriate fare for the journey for the service(s) used, whether that's bus, Tube, NR or river bus services;</li>
</ul>
<p>Please remember that service delay refunds are suspended during strike action.</p>
