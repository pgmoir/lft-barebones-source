        Better services and more of the network served than during the last strike. In central London, most stations open and most services running.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>As Londoners prepare to head home, trains are now running on ten of the eleven Tube lines. </p>
<p>Up to 40 per cent of Tube services operated today as the 'paralysis' predicted by the leaderships of the RMT and TSSA unions once again failed to materialise. </p>
<p>All of London's key stations are operating, including Liverpool Street, London Bridge, Victoria, Euston, Stratford, Waterloo, Holborn, Heathrow, Kings Cross, Finsbury Park, Paddington, Earl's Court, and Whitechapel.</p>
<p>Only the Circle line has no services. </p>
<p>With virtually all Circle line stations being served by other lines an operational decision was made not to run Circle line services, and to maximise the service on other parts of the network instead. </p>
<h2>Good service operating</h2>

<p>Services are currently operating as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>A service is operating on the Central line between Leytonstone and White City </li>
<li>The Central line is operating between White City and Leytonstone </li>
<li>Waterloo &amp; City line is operating a good service </li>
<li>A service is operating across the length of the Northern line </li>
<li>The Bakerloo line is operating between Queen's Park and Elephant &amp; Castle&nbsp; </li>
<li>The Victoria line is operating between Walthamstow Central and Brixton </li>
<li>The Jubilee line is operating between Waterloo and Stratford </li>
<li>The District line is operating between Ealing Broadway/Wimbledon and Barking </li>
<li>The Metropolitan line is operating between Moorgate and Amersham/Chesham and Uxbridge </li>
<li>The Piccadilly line is operating a service between Acton Town and Heathrow 123, and a service at the northern end of the line </li>
<li>The Hammersmith &amp; City line is operating between Hammersmith and Aldgate </li></ul>
<p>The situation continues to be fluid, with other Tube services operating when possible. </p>
<p>Disruption is possible into the evening and some stations will be closed on sections of the lines that are being served. </p>
<p>Passengers are advised to complete their journeys as early into the evening as possible as late evening services may be reduced or withdrawn in preparation for full services resuming tomorrow morning. </p>
<p>Check before travelling using the <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk">TfL website</a>.</p>

<h2>Check before you travel</h2>
<p>Good services are operating on the bus network, Docklands Light Railway, and London Overground.</p>

<p>More than 100 extra bus services have been provided, along with capacity for an additional 10,000 journeys on river services and marshalled taxi ranks. </p>
<p>The number travelling by Barclays Cycle Hire bike increased by around 25 per cent.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Volunteers are on hand at bus, Tube, and rail stations to help passengers and distribute walking maps and other useful information.</p>
<p>Howard Collins, Chief Operating Officer of London Underground (LU), said: 'The unions have once again failed to bring London to a halt.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Although most Londoners will have experienced some disruption, we have had up to 40 per cent of Tube trains running today and, together with additional bus and river services, we have kept London moving. </p>
<p>'We've got trains running on ten of our eleven lines, and all of our key stations have been served. </p>
<p>'It is incredible that the two union leaderships have pursued this action when they have been given cast-iron assurances that the staffing changes we are making come with no compulsory redundancies or loss of earnings, that every station that currently has a ticket office will retain one, and that every station will remain staffed at all times. </p>
<p>'They should now see sense, and call off this pointless industrial action.'<br></p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Some LU ticket offices now regularly sell fewer than 10 tickets an hour. The quietest ticket offices include North Ealing, which sells under six tickets per hour, and Latimer Road and Moor Park, which sell only around seven tickets per hour </li>
<li>Overall, sales from ticket offices are down 28 per cent over the last four years as more and more people switch to Oyster, just one in 20 Tube journeys now starts with a visit to a ticket office&nbsp; </li>
<li>Under LU's proposals staff will be more effectively deployed to areas of stations where they can better assist customers, removing duplication of roles whilst delivering the best possible value for fare and taxpayers </li>
<li>The proposed changes would mean a reduction in the total number of posts across LU, but will involve no compulsory redundancies, and will have no impact on the Tube's high safety standards&nbsp; </li>
<li>The changes would not affect Tube drivers, and the majority of the roughly 800 posts that are identified for reduction are ticket office staff; this also includes a saving of around 150 posts from reductions in management and administrative staff. This is out of a total of around 19,000 LU staff, so represents less than five per cent of the workforce. Some 250 positions are already, or are expected to become vacant, so these would merely not be filled<br></li></ul>
