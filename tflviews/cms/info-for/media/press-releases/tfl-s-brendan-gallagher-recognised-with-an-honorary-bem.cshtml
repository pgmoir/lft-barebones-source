<p>Transport for London's Brendan Gallagher has been recognised with an Honorary BEM for services to Young People.</p>

<p>The Honorary British awards are given to foreign nationals, such as Brendan who originally comes from Sligo in Ireland, for their services.</p>

<p>Brendan Gallagher, from Southgate, has been recognised for his commitment and determination to raising money for children with physical disabilities and additional sensory needs, something he does in addition to his exemplary efforts in his everyday role as a Customer Services Manager on the Northern line.</p>

<p>He has been dedicated to the Northern line Children's Fund since 2001, which is a charity that supports young people with learning difficulties as well as those facing adversity.</p>

<p>In his determination as Chairman, along with his infectious enthusiasm, he has transformed it from a committee of members who arranged small local staff fundraising events into a thriving fund, which has encouraged people to dig deep into their pockets and donate, coordinating activity along the whole of the Northern line.</p>

<p>Working alongside Lisa Sainsbury, a Train Operations Manager's Assistant and the Treasurer of the Northern line Children's Fund, they have raised more than &pound;100,000 together and will be out raising money along the Northern Line this Christmas for the fund.</p>

<h2>Infectious enthusiasm</h2>

<p>Over the years, Brendan has put incredible efforts into developing relationships with schools, such as Richard Cloudesley School in Islington &#45; which the Fund has been supporting for fifty years - and Oakleigh School in Whetstone, in order to provide children with improved facilities and more equipment through fundraising activities.</p>

<p>His hard work and fundraising, along with his colleagues, has also enabled the Northern line Children's Fund to sponsor many different things at the schools, including a residential trip to Germany and day trips to the seaside.</p>

<p>Currently, it supports a sixth form award at Richard Cloudesley School, which is a special needs school that caters for children between 2 and 19 years old.</p>

<p>This award enables a student to be presented with a trophy and recognised for making the most effort and achievement throughout the year.</p>

<p>Representatives from the Northern line Children's Fund join an annual awards night, which celebrates the students' amazing achievements.</p>

<p>The fund also enables all primary pupils to receive a Christmas present - as part of this, Brendan and Lisa come to the school to deliver the presents and join the staff in making Christmas a very special time.</p>

<p>Mike Brown MVO, London's Transport Commissioner, said: 'Brendan really deserves this recognition for his selfless efforts to improve the lives of children with physical disabilities and additional sensory needs, while also working hard to make sure that customers using the Northern line get to where they need to be. He is an inspiration both within TfL and the wider community.'</p>

<h2>Positive impact</h2>

<p>Brendan Gallagher, Customer Services Manager, said: 'I am pleased to be recognised with this honour and I hope that it inspires more people to realise the positive impact they can have on their community, whether that's making a donation or taking on a more active role through fundraising.</p>

<p>'It is truly wonderful to see the effect that the money we raise on the Northern line can make, seeing children's faces light up in surprise, excitement and laughter.'</p>

<p>Caroline Brown, Assistant Headteacher at the Richard Cloudesley School, said: 'We are truly delighted that Brendan has been recognised for his ongoing commitment and dedication to supporting our school.</p>

<p>'This comes at a very opportune time as we reach our 50th year of working with the Northern Line. We are very proud of this association and would like to thank Brendan for enabling us to take part in many extra events and activities with the pupils at our school as a result of his efforts.</p>

<p>'We hope he reflects on this award and recognises that he is a special man who quietly empowers others to make a difference. Congratulations Brendan.'</p>
