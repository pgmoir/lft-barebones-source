        Transport for London (TfL) today announced that it has cancelled weekend closures for the Northern line upgrade, which had been due to take place between Kennington and Morden on 7-8 August, 21-22 August and Bank Holiday Monday 30 August.

<p>Services will operate as usual on these dates while London Underground (LU)&nbsp;continues to review the Northern line upgrade programme following the acquisition of Tube Lines by TfL at the end of June.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Since the acquisition TfL has started to fully understand the state of the upgrade work that, under the Public Private Partnership (PPP), was being carried out by Tube Lines. </p>
<p>The work on the Northern line was predicated upon Tube Lines' work on the Jubilee line being completed but it has been delayed by nearly eight months already, meaning knock-on effects for the Northern line work.</p>
<p>TfL is continuing its urgent assessment of the Northern line upgrade work and the closures that are needed to deliver it. </p>
<p>The objective will be to deliver the upgrade with significantly less disruption and far fewer closures, to a timetable that suits passengers and businesses. </p>
<p>The weekend closure for 14-15 August between Camden Town to Kennington, via Charing Cross will still take place as that closure is for upgrade work at Tottenham Court Road station.</p>
<h2>Check before you travel</h2>
<p>Mike Brown, Managing Director for LU said: 'Since taking control of Tube Lines we have been working hard to minimise the disruption to our customers on the Northern line. </p>
<p>'The key is to get the job done with fewer closures and with a timetable that suits passengers and businesses. </p>
<p>'Where work is ready to begin we will push ahead, but where other parts of Tube Lines' delayed upgrade programme is diverting resources we want to ensure that we do not inconvenience Londoners unnecessarily.'</p>
<p>The Northern line is London's busiest line, and upgrade work is vital to replace the 40 year old signalling system. </p>
<p>Once upgraded with new signalling passengers will benefit from faster journey times, improved reliability and extra capacity. </p>
<p>At the end of June TfL also cancelled the early evening closures originally planned by Tube Lines for the Northern line. </p>
<p>The Northern upgrade is not part of the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games travel plan and the Northern line will run a full service for the duration of the Olympic and Paralympic Games.</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<p>LU is undertaking a major programme of renewal as part of TfL's Investment Programme. This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options. The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future. TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground, London Tramlink and Docklands Light Railway passengers to <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/check">'check before they travel' </a>at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary.<br></p>
