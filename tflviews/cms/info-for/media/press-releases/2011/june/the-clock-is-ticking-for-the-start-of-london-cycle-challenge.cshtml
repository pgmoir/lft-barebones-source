            <p>With the start of the London Cycle Challenge fast approaching, Mayor of London Boris Johnson is urging teams get registered and maximise their miles.</p>
<p>Thousands of Londoners have already signed up to take part in this year's event, which is run by Transport for London (TfL) and takes place between 18 June and 15 July. </p>
<p>Miles mean points, so by logging miles from the very start, each team stands the greatest chance of glory. </p>
<p>To encourage beginners, the first miles cycled are worth the most points, so get as many members on board as you can.</p>
<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'As part of my ongoing work to create a 'cyclised' London the challenge is out there every year to teams to take part in this terrific event. </p>
<p>'With bragging rights at stake I would urge all teams that have not already registered to do so by the start date and give themselves the best chance of victory.'</p>
<p>Groups of friends, families, work colleagues or schools can create teams to challenge each other and other teams to see who can cycle the most miles. </p>
<h2>Free entry</h2>
<p>All cycle journeys count - for work or for fun - even out of London, and there are prizes of cycling goodies for small, medium and large teams. </p>
<p>It is free to enter and online team registration is open to everyone who lives, works or studies in London. </p>
<p>Plus, thanks to the Barclays Cycle Hire scheme - you don't even need to own your own bike to get involved.</p>
<p>This year, entrants will also benefit from the arrival of the Barclays Cycle Superhighways - a series of cycle routes into central London from Outer London which provide cyclists with safer, faster and more direct journeys into the city. </p>
<p>The first two have launched, with two more opening in summer 2011 and the remaining eight introduced by 2015.</p>
<p>One of the more unusual entrants is Dynasty Mas Carnival Band, who will be showcasing their spectacular carnival costumes in front of the million-plus visitors at the Notting Hill Carnival in August. </p>
<p>Costume design co-ordinator Barbie Munro said: 'This year we are combining cycle challenge with our 'get fit for the road' campaign. </p>
<p>'Parading along the streets of Notting Hill over two days can be a real test of endurance so we urge all our masqueraders to get fit. </p>
<h2>Score a victory</h2>
<p>'We will log miles as we cycle to and from the gym, aerobic and dance classes to get in shape. </p>
<p>'Hopefully we can secure a double victory in both Cycle Challenge and best costume competition at carnival.'</p>
<p>Entrants simply need to visit the <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/cyclechallenge">TfL website</a> where they can join or register a team, and then log their miles throughout the challenge. </p>
<p>Progress can be checked on a real-time leader board and friendly rivalry is encouraged by joining the London Cycle Challenge 2011 Facebook group. </p>
<p>A short promotional film about the challenge also appears on the website.</p>
<p>Last year more than 10,000 Londoners took part in the challenge. </p>
<p>If you want to get involved, but are not a regular cyclist, there is plenty of support available including TfL supported cycle training and a series of cycle guides which will help get you started and find your way around London.</p>
