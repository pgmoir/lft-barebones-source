                            The private hire industry and the taxi trade will be consulted during the next two months

<p>Presently, no external signage is allowed on private hire 
vehicles, only the vehicle licence disc displayed on the front and back windows 
of the vehicle, which identifies that the vehicle is licensed. </p>
<p>The private hire industry and the taxi trade will be among those who will be 
consulted during the next two months. </p>
<p>Roy Ellis, Head of PCO, said: "External signage is an important issue that 
needs to be discussed. </p>
<p>"A previous consultation proved inconclusive and we urge all those involved 
in the consultation process to contribute. </p>
<p>"Whilst many in the private hire trade feel that additional signage would 
help to make vehicles more easily identifiable for passengers who have to book 
in advance, other people claim that this could make the vehicles more 
susceptible to being hailed on the street.</p>
<p>Only licensed taxis can be hailed on the street, private hire vehicles have 
to be pre booked.</p>
<h2>Public safety</h2>
<p>"Ultimately we want the public to be safe when using taxi and private hire 
vehicles, so we need be very thorough during this consultation process."</p>
<p>The consultation will also look at the issue of extending the private hire 
vehicle licensing inspections to include a mechanical inspection of the vehicle. 
</p>
<p>Consultation documents were sent out on Friday 18 November 2005.</p>
<p>The consultation ends on 31 January 2006.<br></p>
