<li>RMT refuse to suspend strike despite progress on all issues </li>
<li>Transport for London (TfL)&nbsp;calls on RMT to continue talks at ACAS tomorrow</li></ul>
<p>Despite the start of the strike, TfL called on the RMT leadership to return to ACAS tomorrow for more talks to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Progress has been made on all issues, including pay and the RMT leadership's demand that two members of staff dismissed for serious disciplinary offences be reinstated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, they refused to suspend the strike beyond their own self-imposed deadline.</p>
<p>Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy, said: 'Despite us making progress on all issues today, the RMT leadership has decided to strike, rather than continue to talk beyond their own self-imposed deadline.</p>
<p>'The RMT leadership says we were close to a deal.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'If that is the case, then they should call off the strike, return to talks at ACAS tomorrow and resolve this issue without any more disruption to Londoners.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'We remain ready for talks at any time'<br></p>
