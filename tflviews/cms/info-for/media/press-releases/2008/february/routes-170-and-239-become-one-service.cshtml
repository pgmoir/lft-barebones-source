            <p>Route 170 will run from Roehampton to Victoria via Clapham Junction, replacing route 239 which will no longer run. </p>
<p>There will be a more frequent service for passengers along the existing route 170. </p>
<p>Route 170 will be the same as now between Roehampton and Clapham Junction station on St John's Hill. </p>

<p>During the evening, and during the day on Sunday, there will be a bus every 12 minutes (currently every 15 minutes on the 170 and every 12 minutes on the 239).</p>
<p>John Barry, Head of Network Development for London Buses, said: "The route will provide a direct link from Roehampton to Victoria.</p>
<p>"The new 170 service will give higher frequency for passengers in Roehampton and Putney Heath."</p>
<p>The change comes following a review of the existing service.</p>
