            <p>The Mayor of London today confirmed &pound;3.2m for Merton to spend on local transport improvements during 2010/11, including &pound;372,000 for essential road maintenance and &pound;650,000 for major schemes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Merton has been developing proposals for a number of schemes that it will be financing with the funding package, including: </p> <ul> <li>&pound;340,000 for improvements to the Mitcham town centre corridor smoothing traffic flow, improving access and safety  </li><li>&pound;254,000 for improvements to the public realm in Broadway/Wimbledon Hill Road (between Mansel Road &amp; Wimbledon Theatre)  </li><li>&pound;250,000 to improve access to local shopping parades including improvements to footways and street furniture  </li><li>&pound;50,000 for cycle parking, focusing on town centres  </li><li>&pound;650,000 for public realm improvements to the South Wimbledon business area including better paving and lighting to improve pedestrian access</li></ul> <p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'Even in these tough economic times I am committed to providing this funding to all of London's boroughs. </p> <p>'The investment means that across the Capital, town centres and public spaces are being overhauled, cycling and walking facilities are being improved, and roads are being made safer. </p> <p>'We have cut red tape to make it easier for borough councils to choose the local transport projects that benefit their residents the most, simplifying the funding system and working together to give local people the improvements they want.</p> <p>'This time we're also giving an extra focus to cycling - helping to provide the training, cycle parking, and maintenance knowhow to support the introduction of the first two Cycle Superhighways next year.'</p> <p>Funding for local schemes is allocated each year by Transport for London (TfL).</p> <p>The Mayor has simplified the system - reducing the number of funding streams from 23 to five, and introducing fairer funding formulas where needed.&nbsp; </p> <h2>Promoting greener travel</h2> <p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Merton has identified a range of small and large scale projects that will make a real difference to local people by improving town centres and public spaces, reducing the number of collisions on our roads, improving the environment and promoting greener forms of travel.&nbsp; </p> <p>'Merton also has the flexibility to move certain funding between projects if, during the course of the year, they find more or less funding is needed for individual schemes.'</p> <p>Alongside Local Implementation Plan (LIP) allocation for cycling projects, the Mayor announced an additional &pound;156,000 for Merton as part of a &pound;1.49m funding for the two pilot Cycle Superhighways being delivered next year.</p> <p>The money has been allocated to provide the appropriate cycle training, parking and maintenance to address the increase in demand from residents living near the new cycling infrastructure, part of the Mayor's cycling revolution in London.</p> <p>The money allocated to Merton is as follows:</p> <p> <div class="table-container"><table height="131" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" width="490" border="1"> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><strong>&nbsp;Cycle training</strong></p> <p><strong>&pound;'000</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>&nbsp;Cycle maintenance/travel awareness</strong></p> <p><strong>&pound;'000</strong></p></td> <td> <p><strong>&nbsp;Cycle parking&nbsp;</strong></p> <p><strong>&pound;'000</strong></p></td> <td> <p>&nbsp;<strong>Additional funding subject to further work</strong></p> <p><strong>&pound;'000</strong></p></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;40</td> <td>&nbsp;14.1</td> <td>&nbsp;0</td> <td>&nbsp;101.7</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;<strong>Total&nbsp;
