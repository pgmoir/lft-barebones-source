        B-Type 'Battle Bus' and a poppy livery New Routemaster bus supplied for the event

 <div class="on-this-page">

        <p>On Saturday 8 November half
        a million people are expected to line the streets of the City and Westminster
        for the Lord Mayor's Show procession and fireworks.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>To celebrate the of Year of
        the Bus, Transport for London (TfL) and London Transport Museum have partnered
        up to enter two vehicles in the 2014 Lord Mayor's Show &#45; a B-type 'Battle Bus'
        and a New Routemaster with eye catching poppy livery.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        Leon Daniels,
        TfL's Managing Director of Surface Transport, said: `It's
        only fitting that both the historical importance and the exciting future of
        London's buses is to be celebrated as part of one of London's most
        time-honoured events. Our buses don't just transport
        people around the capital &#45; they have played a key role in shaping its social
        and economic landscape and we're looking forward to seeing their contribution
        being recognised in the Lord Mayor's Show.` &nbsp;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Sam Mullins, Director of
        London Transport Museum, said: `Battle Buses were transformed from red London
        buses into their green-coloured wartime appearance so they could serve on the
        Western Front during the First World War.
        &nbsp; </p>
        <p>`The B-Type bus is a
        memorial to the many transport staff &#45; drivers, mechanics, guards, porters and
        office staff - who served and lost their lives during the First World War. For
        those who want to find out more our exhibition Good Bye Piccadilly from Home
        Front to Western Front reveals the many untold stories of the
        essential role undertaken by London busmen and women, and their buses in the
        war effort, both at home and abroad.`
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The khaki coloured Battle
        Bus is one of only a handful of operational B-type buses and this type of
        vehicle was used to transport troops during the First World War.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>More
        than 1,000 London buses were deployed by the War Department overseas during the
        conflict. Many of the 'battle buses' were driven by civilian drivers who only
        weeks before had been driving them along the capital's streets. The battle
        buses often got into difficulties on narrow muddy country roads, and did much
        of their work near the front line at night to avoid being shelled.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>To mark the centenary of
        the First World War, TfL has created a special poppy design with the line from
        the famous First World War poem by John McCrae, 'In Flanders fields the poppies
        blow'. Two Tube trains, one on the Metropolitan line and one on the Circle
        line, a London Overground train and ten London buses have been completely
        wrapped in the design.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Up to 50 members
        of staff and LTM volunteers will be taking part in the procession &#45; either
        working on the buses or walking alongside them. Also riding on London Transport
        Museum's Battle Bus will be a number of Sikh soldiers, dressed in First World
        War uniforms.
        &nbsp;
        This group is
        present to commemorate the participation of those soldiers who fought for the
        Commonwealth in the First War and is from the National Army Museum
        &nbsp;
        The procession is over
        three and a half miles long between Bank and Aldwych from 1100 until about
        1430.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Road and public transport users are advised that
        there will be some road closures and bus
        diversions, and Tube and rail stations in the area may be busier than usual.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Road
        closures will include Bishopsgate in the east, Old Street in the north, Aldwych
        in the west and Victoria Embankment to the south. Blackfriars Bridge will be
        closed from 7am and Waterloo Bridge from 4pm. All roads and bridges are
        expected to be re-opened by around 6pm.
        &nbsp;
        Drivers
        are advised to avoid the affected areas if possible and allow more time to
        travel. Public transport, walking and cycling will be the best way to get
        around, although buses in the affected areas will be on diversion or will
        terminate earlier than usual. </p>
        <p>A small number of Barclays Cycle Hire docking
        stations will also be suspended during the event. </p>

        Events and activities
        are being held throughout 2014 to celebrate TfL's Year of the Bus, in
        partnership with the London Transport Museum and the capital's bus operators &#45;
        specifically the role that London buses, bus drivers and the staff who support
        them play in keeping the capital moving.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The Year of the Bus also marks a
        number of important anniversaries including 60 years since the creation of the
        original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its predecessor
        the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were sent to the
        Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.
        &nbsp;
        During the Year of the Bus, TfL has worked on a
        number of high profile collaborations including with the world-famous
        Fender&nbsp;guitar manufacturer whose Stratocaster guitar celebrated its 60th&nbsp;anniversary this year; with LEGO to install an operational bus
        stop and shelter on Regent Street made entirely out of LEGO and a special
        Routemaster Google Doodle on the Google.co.uk homepage.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Year of the
        Bus has also seen the first ever series of live music performances on board a
        New Routemaster bus as part of Oxjam, and 'bus stop top' exhibitions along the Strand
        from renowned photographers Juergen Teller and David LaChapelle. </p>

        <p>'Ole Bill, B43, one of the first
        buses to be sent overseas, was presented to George V in 1920. The bus became a
        mobile war memorial and participated in with bus and underground staff in
        Armistice Day parades from the 1920s. </p>
