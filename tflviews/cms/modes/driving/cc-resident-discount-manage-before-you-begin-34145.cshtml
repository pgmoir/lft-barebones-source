<p>You can only have 1 vehicle on this discount at a time.</p>

<p>You must be the registered keeper of the vehicle and it must be registered with the DVLA at the address you use to apply for the residents' discount.</p>

<p>You can also add a company car or lease vehicle as long as it is for your own use.</p>

<p>To add a vehicle to your discount you need evidence to support your request - you have 40 days to supply this to us. If you miss this deadline, your vehicle will be removed from the discount and you must pay the Congestion Charge in full.</p>

<h3>Refunds</h3>

<p>If you have already paid the charge for the vehicle currently on your residents' discount, any remaining days will be automatically refunded back to the card used to make the original payment. If you paid by cheque the refund will be made by cheque.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can pay the charge for your new vehicle online once you have completed this process.&nbsp;</p>
