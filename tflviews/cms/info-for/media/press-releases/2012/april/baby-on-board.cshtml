<p>MUMS-to-be travelling by Tube can get a baby on board badge so passengers know they may need to sit down.</p>

<p>The badges, available from Transport for London (TfL), overcome the awkwardness often felt by pregnant women of having to ask someone to give up their seat.</p>

<p>It also means passengers in priority seats can see when they should give up their place.</p>

<p>Research undertaken before the scheme was launched showed that pregnant women often felt awkward or uncomfortable having to ask if they could sit<br>down. </p>

<p>And while some people said they were happy to offer their seats to expectant mums, they felt embarrassed if their offer was rejected.</p>
