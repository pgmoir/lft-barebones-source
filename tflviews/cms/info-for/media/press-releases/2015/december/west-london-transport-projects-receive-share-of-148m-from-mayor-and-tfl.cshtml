<p>Transport services and town centres in West London have been given a New Year boost, as the Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) have confirmed &pound;148 million in funding for improvement projects in the London's boroughs in 2016/17.</p>
<p>The annual borough funding is provided by TfL to help the boroughs pay for local transport projects set out in their Local Implementation Plans (LIPs). LIPs are plans that show how the boroughs will support the Mayor's Transport Strategy in their area. For 2016/17, TfL's financial support for the boroughs' LIPs has been maintained at &pound;147.8 million and will fund improvements that benefit local communities.</p>
<p>The funding will support a range of different transport projects across West London delivered by the boroughs. Local areas will see safer roads, better public spaces, improved walking facilities and cycling made safer and easier.</p>
<p>Each borough will receive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Brent - &pound;3.7 million including &pound;210,000 over two years for the Forty Lane Corridor Improvements, which will deliver a new signal junction and improved facilities for pedestrians and cyclists to reduce casualties on the route into Wembley</li>
    <li>Richmond - &pound;2.5 million including &pound;315,000 towards a programme of new cycle routes, cycle training and cycle parking to encourage more people in the area to take up two wheels;</li>
    <li>Ealing - &pound;5.6 million including &pound;670,000 towards measures that make cycling safer including; cycle parking, training and the council's Direct Support for Cycling funding programme;</li>
    <li>Harrow - &pound;2.4 million including &pound;120,000 towards the introduction of 20mph zones around Park High School and Longfield School to improve road safety;</li>
    <li>Hounslow - &pound;5.5 million including &pound;2.3 million for the Feltham High Street improvements, which will deliver improved accessibility in the town centre and improved provision for cyclists and bus users;</li>
    <li>Hillingdon - &pound;5.8 million including &pound;60,000 for improvements around the Grand Union canal that will create a safe, quiet and natural walkway;</li>
    <li>Hammersmith and Fulham - &pound;2.3 million including &pound;500,000 towards the introduction of 20mph limits across the borough to help make streets safer</li>
    <li>Kensington and Chelsea - &pound;2.1 million including &pound;150,000 for pedestrian improvements at the junction of Old Brompton Road / Pelham Street</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson MP, said: `This latest round of funding will help to transform scores of locations in all four corners of our great city. It is specifically targeted to help make our roads, town centres and open spaces more attractive places with better facilities for walking and safer cycling. By helping the boroughs deliver on important local transport schemes, we can help to spur jobs and growth across London.'</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown MVO, said: `People in West London will see real improvements to their local areas as a result of this funding. Working with West London boroughs, hundreds of transport projects will be delivered that will benefit pedestrians and road users, through safer streets and improved public squares and shopping areas. These improvements will help transform communities and boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>In addition to funding for boroughs, TfL is working with them to help further improve the efficiency of the delivery of projects, ensuring value for money and keeping disruption to a minimum.</p>
<p>Last year, the boroughs in West London used TfL funding to deliver a range of improvements for local communities, through safer junctions, reduced traffic speeds and better walking routes.</p>
<p>Significant projects in West London awarded funding last year included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hillingdon - &pound;1.9 million towards the &pound;7 million project to improve Hayes Town Centre, which included reopening Station road to through traffic and a new roundabout at Station Road/Botwell Lane</li>
    <li>Richmond - &pound;500,000 towards highway and streetscape improvements in Twickenham town centre as part of preparations for the successful Rugby World Cup</li>
    <li>Brent - &pound;395,000 for the Harlesden Town Centre 'routes in' scheme to reduce pedestrian casualties and improve the public realm on the approaches to the town centre</li>
    <li>Kensington and Chelsea - &pound;55,000 towards a &pound;1.7 million Golborne Road streetscape improvement project, which will create more space for pedestrians and market traders near Portobello Road.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ol>
    <li>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.  While Transport for London allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough</li>
    <li>The overall 2016/17 LIPs budget of &pound;147.8 million is allocated as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>&pound;74.25 million is allocated for Corridors, Neighbourhoods &amp; Supporting Measures</li>
    <li>&pound;28 million is allocated to Major Schemes</li>
    <li>&pound;8.9 million is awarded for Bridge Strengthening (individual allocations to boroughs to be made in January 2016)</li>
    <li>&pound;10.3 million is allocated for Traffic Signal Modernisation for sites across London</li>
    <li>&pound;4.35 million is allocated for apprenticeships, staff training and support for partnerships</li>
    <li>&pound;21 million is allocated for Principal Road Maintenance based on condition surveys</li>
    <li>&pound;1 million is held for Principal Road Maintenance emergency works and condition surveys</li>
</ul>
