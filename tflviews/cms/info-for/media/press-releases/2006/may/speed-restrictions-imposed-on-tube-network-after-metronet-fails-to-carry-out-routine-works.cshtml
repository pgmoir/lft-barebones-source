                            Why should Londoners put up with this?

            <p>This is a standard rail industry activity to allow for expansion due to heat. 20mph speed restrictions, to ensure safe running of trains, are currently in place on sections of the District, Hammersmith & City, Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines. </p>
<p>The areas most affected are the east and west ends of the District line, the north end of the Metropolitan line and the west end of the Piccadilly line.</p>
<p>Peter Hendy, Commissioner of Transport for London (TfL), said: "This is the latest in a series of inexcusable failures by Metronet. </p>
<p>"Why should Londoners put up with this? </p>
<p>"We're not even in a heat wave yet. This is simply poor management and planning.</p>
<p>"The reputation of Metronet's shareholders - Atkins, Balfour Beatty, Bombardier Transportation, EDF Energy and Thames Water - are being severely damaged by their association with this shambles. </p>
<p>"The consortium's shareholders will have to step in and sort out this dreadful mess."</p>
<p>London Underground management is holding talks with Metronet to learn how they plan to rectify this latest series of failures, and to ensure London Underground does not face similar problems throughout the spring and summer.</p>
<p>Passengers should call 020 7222 1234 or check online at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk">www.tfl.gov.uk</a> for the latest information before travelling and allow extra time for their journeys.</p>
<p>Metronet Rail SSL is responsible for the renewal and maintenance of the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City, Metropolitan and East London lines. </p>
<p>It is also responsible for the maintenance of the Piccadilly line between Hammersmith and Acton Town.<br></p>
<p>
            <ul>
<li>TfL is investing &pound;10bn over the next five years to improve and expand London's transport network, more than half of that in the Tube as we work to Transform the Tube.<br></li></ul>
