<p>Transport services and town centres in East London have been given a New Year boost, as the Mayor and Transport for London (TfL) have confirmed &pound;148 million in funding for improvement projects in London's boroughs in 2016/17.</p>
<p>The annual borough funding is provided by TfL to help the boroughs pay for local transport projects set out in their Local Implementation Plans (LIPs). LIPs are plans that show how the boroughs will support the Mayor's Transport Strategy in their area. For 2016/17, TfL's financial support for the boroughs' LIPs has been maintained at &pound;147.8 million and will fund improvements that benefit local communities.</p>
<p>The funding will support a range of different transport projects across East London delivered by the boroughs. Local areas will see safer roads, better public spaces, improved walking facilities and cycling made safer and easier.</p>
<p>Each borough will receive:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Newham - &pound;5.5 million including &pound;100,000 towards reducing congestion in the borough, which will improve traffic flows around the Drill roundabout junction;</li>
    <li>Hackney &#45; &pound;3.9 million including &pound;250,000 towards improving Well/Mare Street junction with the possible removal of staggered crossings that will make it safer for pedestrians and cyclists;</li>
    <li>Barking and Dagenham &#45; &pound;2.1 million including &pound;350,000 towards a range of highways and public realm improvements, including enhancements to the Gale Street shopping parade in Dagenham to improve safety and accessibility</li>
    <li>Tower Hamlets &#45; &pound;2.8 million including &pound;300,000 towards introducing 20mph limits across the borough to help make streets safer</li>
    <li>Waltham Forest &#45; &pound;3.2 million including &pound;2.2 million to support a major scheme to help improve the area around Blackhorse Road Station and road safety, that will include new speed bumps, pavement widening and new access to the Wetlands centre;</li>
    <li>Havering  - &pound;3.3 million including &pound;140,000 for delivering walking and cycling improvements to the All London Green Grid in Havering;</li>
    <li>Redbridge &#45;&pound;3.1million including &pound;100,000 to complete the Roding Valley Way project and to help create improved links into Wanstead park and improve signage for the local cycle network</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson MP, said: `This latest round of funding will help to transform scores of locations in all four corners of our great city. It is specifically targeted to help make our roads, town centres and open spaces more attractive places with better facilities for walking and safer cycling. By helping the boroughs deliver on important local transport schemes, we can help to spur jobs and growth across London.'</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown MVO, said: `People in East London will see real improvements to their local areas as a result of this funding. Working with East London boroughs, hundreds of transport projects will be delivered that will benefit pedestrians and road users through safer streets and improved public squares and shopping areas. These improvements will help transform communities and boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>In addition to funding for boroughs, TfL is also working with them to help further improve the efficiency of the delivery of projects, ensuring value for money and keeping disruption to a minimum.</p>
<p>Last year, the boroughs in East London used TfL funding to deliver a range of improvements for local communities, through safer junctions, reduced traffic speeds and better walking routes.</p>
<p>Significant projects in East London awarded funding last year included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Barking and Dagenham - &pound;400,000 to improve the junction between Ballards Road and New Road, addressing long-standing safety and congestion issues, and making it easier for cyclists and pedestrians to use</li>
    <li>Hackney - &pound;270,000 for design to help regenerate the shopping environment in Hackney by pedestrianising Narrow Way to provide a safer and more inviting environment for pedestrians and cyclists;</li>
    <li>Newham - &pound;1 million to commence the detailed design on the conversion of Stratford Gyratory to two-way operation, reducing the dominance of traffic and significantly improving conditions for cyclists, pedestrians, public transport users<hr />
    </li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.  While Transport for London allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough</li>
    <li>The overall 2016/17 LIPs budget of &pound;147.8m is allocated as follows:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li>&pound;74.25m is allocated for Corridors, Neighbourhoods &amp; Supporting Measures</li>
    <li>&pound;28m is allocated to Major Schemes</li>
    <li>&pound;8.9m is awarded for Bridge Strengthening (individual allocations to boroughs to be made in January 2016)</li>
    <li>&pound;10.3m is allocated for Traffic Signal Modernisation for sites across London</li>
    <li>&pound;4.35m is allocated for apprenticeships, staff training and support for partnerships</li>
    <li>&pound;21m is allocated for Principal Road Maintenance based on condition surveys</li>
    <li>&pound;1m is held for Principal Road Maintenance emergency works and condition surveys</li>
</ul>
<ul>
</ul>
