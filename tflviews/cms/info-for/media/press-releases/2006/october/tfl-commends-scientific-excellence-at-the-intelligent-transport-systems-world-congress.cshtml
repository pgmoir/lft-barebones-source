                            Dr Renfrew's paper offers a glimpse of how one form of transport system might operate safely in the future

            <p>The winners are from the University of Manchester. Dr Alasdair Renfrew, Aurelio Gonz&aacute;lez-Villase&ntilde;or and Paul Brunn have won the award for their paper 'Zero-Headway Bridging Dampers for Fault Tolerant Co-operative Highways'.</p>
<p>The paper outlines a new concept to solve the problem of system failures within an automatically controlled car convoy system, or platoon of cars, where physical contact between vehicles is allowed under controlled conditions. </p>
<p>The system provides an additional cushion between vehicles that has a number of safety and operational benefits which particularly impressed the judging panel.</p>
<p>The paper also sets out future work in the context of the wider co-operative vehicle highway systems and demonstrates a research potential which has a direct impact for users. </p>
<p>Martin Davey, Chair of the Judging Panel and Project Director of TfL's Technical Services Group, said: "Dr Renfrew's paper offers a glimpse of how one form of transport system might operate safely in the future. </p>
<p>"Transport for London is proud to support this kind of forward thinking and the team from Manchester University are worthy recipients of the Best Scientific Paper Award."</p>
<p>Dr Renfrew presented his paper to the Congress in a technical session on Monday 9 October. </p>
<p>The TfL Best Scientific Paper Award is being made at the ITS World Congress Closing Ceremony at 2pm on Thursday 12 October at London's ExCeL centre. </p>
