 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>People living or working in Hillingdon, Harrow and Ealing are being encouraged to take part in the consultation.</p>
<p>It is proposed that existing route 398 be split into two separate services.</p>
<p>The revised route 398 would run from Ruislip to the Wood End Estate in Northolt, providing the estate with a bus service for the first time.</p>
<p>New route 395 would run from Harrow-on-the-Hill to Westway Cross Retail Park, providing more buses for passengers along the busiest stretch of existing route 398 between South Harrow and Westway Cross Retail Park.</p>
<p>The consultation opens today and closes on Friday, March 20.</p>
<p>Information leaflets on the proposals, including pre-paid reply slips, will be available in the Wood End Library and Community Centre and in other local libraries during the consultation period.</p>
<p>For more information and details of how to respond, go to tfl.gov.uk/busrouteconsultation or call 0845 300 7000</p>
