            <p>The Mayor of London today launched a new deal to enable 
international visitors to buy and receive Oyster cards before they arrive in the 
capital giving them quicker, easier journeys and more time to enjoy their 
trip.</p>
<p>This is thanks to a new partnership between Transport for London and 
VisitBritain. </p>
<p>The agreement means VisitBritain will be the first organisation to sell 
Oyster cards through their on-line shops at: <a href="http://www.visitbritaindirect.com/">www.visitbritaindirect.com</a>. 
VisitBritain's websites target 36 international markets. </p>
<p>London's Oyster card is an electronic smartcard which holds cash and travel 
cards enabling passengers to pay for Tube, bus, Docklands Light Railway and tram 
journeys. Launched in 2003 there are now more than six million in 
circulation.</p>
<p>Oyster is the cheapest way to buy single fares and over several journeys in 
one day, Oyster will calculate the cheapest fare for your travel.</p>
<p>Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: "Oyster is already a proven success 
with Londoners and this new deal will make it easier for millions of overseas 
visitors to get around London.</p>
<p>"The best way for visitors to travel around the Capital is usually by public 
transport so this deal will provide simpler, cheaper and quicker journeys."</p>
<p>Kenny Boyle, VisitBritain's director of commercial and marketing services, 
said: "With more than 12 million visits to our overseas websites every year, 
Transport for London and other commercial organisations recognise that 
VisitBritain can help them reach new customers. </p>
<p>
<h2>Quality experience</h2>
<p>
<p>"The Oyster card is the smartest, quickest and cheapest way around London and 
it's fantastic we can now offer even greater value for money to international 
visitors. </p>
<p>"Together, we can help ensure that our visitors have a quality experience 
from the moment they start to plan their trip to booking and travelling 
here.</p>
<p>"By creating platforms, such as our online shops, we can help tourism 
businesses - large and small - attract more custom."</p>
<p>Initially the cards will go on sale in India, Hong Kong, Singapore, Spain, 
Portugal and the USA followed by the rest of VisitBritain's online shops by 
March 2007.</p>
<p>
<h2>Online shops</h2>
<p>
<p>Giles Bailey, Transport for London's Head of Group Marketing Strategy and 
Integration, said: "We are delighted to have formed this partnership making 
trips for visitors easy and enjoyable. </p>
<p>"Visitors can keep their Oyster cards to use for future visits to London or 
they could be given as a gift or lent to friends and family planning to visit 
London."</p>
<p>By March 2007, VisitBritain's worldwide online shops will sell a wide range 
of tourism products, including transport, event and attraction tickets, 
accommodation guides, touring passes, books and maps, ensuring that their 
websites are the first port of call for visitors as they prepare to travel to 
the UK.</p>
