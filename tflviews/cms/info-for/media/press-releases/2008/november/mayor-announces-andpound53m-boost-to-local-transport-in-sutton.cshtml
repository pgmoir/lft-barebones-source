<p>The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced &pound;5.3m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Sutton to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to &pound;168.3m from &pound;161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.</p>
<p>TfL has included &pound;100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses. </p>
<p>The &pound;5.3m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;1.5m to assess and strengthen the London Road Hackbridge.&nbsp;Work will also include widening the bridge to include new footpath and cycle lane.&nbsp;This will provide a safer route for cyclists, pedestrians and other road users</li>
<li>&pound;670,000 to enhance and upgrade Sutton town centre.&nbsp;Measures will include creating a central square at the apex of the High Street, Throwly Road and Hill Road, extending an improving the pedestrian zone with high quality paving, new lighting and tree planting as well as removing street clutter and introducing accessible crossing points</li>
<li>&pound;160,000 to improve road safety and environmental quality on Sutton Street</li>
<li>&pound;108,000 for cycle training, &pound;14,000 for cycle training for people with disabilities and &pound;60,000 for cycle parking improvements</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'When I was elected I promised I would be different and give greater freedom to the Boroughs.</p>
<p>'This is why this year I have introduced a &pound;100,000 award for Boroughs to spend as they choose.</p>
<p>'Boroughs are being given greater freedom to develop and deliver the schemes they want, which means more choice over a range of key local schemes to improve town centres and cycling facilities, tackle the school run and improve local roads.'<br>&nbsp;<br>'I am awarding Sutton a budget of &pound;5.3m next year for local schemes that will make travelling safer, more accessible and more environment-friendly, helping to improve the quality of life for people across the borough.'</p>
<p>Funding for local transport schemes is allocated each year by TfL in response to the applications from boroughs based on their Local Implementation [transport] Plans (LIPs).</p>
<p>Funding is currently available for a wide range of programmes including road safety, maintaining borough roads, tackling the school run, improving walking, cycling and the local environment, making transport more accessible and measures to improve bus journeys.</p>
