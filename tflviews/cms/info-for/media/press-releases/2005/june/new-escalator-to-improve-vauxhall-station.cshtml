            <p>The works are being carried out by Metronet BCV.</p>
<p>The station is expected to operate as normal during the closure.</p>
<p>The fixed staircase which goes down to the Victoria line platforms will be closed to the public for a period of approximately seven months while it is being replaced by an escalator. </p>
<p>Engineering works will commence on Monday 27 June 2005 and are due to end on 3 February 2006.</p>
<p>The new escalator will only run downwards until congestion work is completed in the ticket hall in 2007/2008. It will then become reversible.</p>
