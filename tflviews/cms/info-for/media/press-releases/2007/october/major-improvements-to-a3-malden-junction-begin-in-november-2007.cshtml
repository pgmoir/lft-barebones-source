<p>Improvements to the A3 Malden Junction which will improve traffic flow, ease congestion and provide safer and more accessible facilities for pedestrians and cyclists, will begin in November 2007 as part of an ongoing investment plan by Transport for London (TfL).</p>
<p>The roundabout, in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames, will&nbsp;undergo essential resurfacing work&nbsp;which will help reduce noise pollution in the area. </p>
<p>In addition, structural repairs&nbsp;will be undertaken to the A3 bridges that support the roundabout.</p>
<p>Work will begin on the 5 November 2007 and is expected to be completed by March 2008. </p>
<p>TfL will make every effort to minimise any inconvenience or disruption that might be caused while these improvements are carried out.<br>&nbsp;<br>The improvements come as part of&nbsp; TfL's &pound;10 billion investment into the Capital's transport network.</p>
            <p>
