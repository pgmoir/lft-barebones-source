                            The upgrade and improvement works have now been completed by Metronet

            <p>Final testing and driver training is now underway and once successfully completed the upgraded and improved line will re-open to passengers.</p>
<p>The upgrade of the Waterloo & City line is part of Transport for London's (TfL's) &pound;10bn Investment Programme to meet London's transport needs now and in the future. </p>
<p>It will deliver faster journey times, more passenger capacity and a more reliable service. </p>
<p>Tube passengers will also benefit from newly refurbished trains painted in the Underground's distinctive red, white and blue livery. </p>
<p>CCTV cameras have been installed in all carriages to improve passenger safety and security.</p>
<p>The upgrade has been an extremely complex project within a challenging timescale. </p>
<p>London Underground has been demanding of Metronet, requiring the delivery of a great deal of work and improvements in a short space of time. </p>
<p>This has largely been achieved in one of the most constrained parts of the network, with delivery a few days behind schedule after a five month closure.</p>
<p>During the five-month closure, the track between Waterloo and Bank has been completely replaced and electrical and communications equipment renewed.</p>
<p>London Underground Service Director Howard Collins said: "We're investing billions to improve the Tube and the Waterloo & City is the latest example of this major investment.</p>
<p>"The upgrade and improvement works have now been completed by Metronet and final testing and staff training is underway. </p>
<p>"We look forward to a safer, more reliable and comfortable Waterloo & City line and for Metronet to continue to deliver improvements to the Tube, as promised."</p>
