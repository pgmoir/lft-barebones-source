<p>The three-day closure will allow the re-commissioning of 
signalling systems on the Terminal 4 loop, in preparation for its reopening next 
month. </p>
<p>This is part of the wider project to extend the Piccadilly line to Heathrow 
Terminal 5 by 2008.</p>
<p>During the closure period, passengers for Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 will 
change onto a shuttle bus service running every few minutes to and from Hatton 
Cross. </p>
<p>Valid Tube tickets will also be accepted on local buses. Passengers for 
Heathrow T4 will continue to use the existing shuttle bus service to and from 
Hatton Cross, which has been in place since January 2005. </p>
<p>Porters will be available at Hatton Cross to assist passengers with heavy 
luggage. </p>
<p>Tube passengers can also travel for free on Heathrow Express rail services 
between Heathrow Terminals 1,2,3 and 4 but not into Central London.</p>
<p>Mike Challis, Piccadilly Line General Manager, said: "The three-day closure 
of the Piccadilly line to Heathrow will allow essential signalling work on the 
Terminal 4 loop, in preparation for its reopening next month. </p>
<p>
<h2>Minimise disruption</h2>
<p>
<p>"We have timed the work carefully to minimise disruption, as fewer people 
travel to Heathrow mid-week at this time of year. </p>
<p>"Extensive alternative arrangements will be in place to cater for Heathrow 
passengers. </p>
<p>"A fleet of shuttle buses will depart every few minutes between Hatton Cross 
and Heathrow, and local bus services will be strengthened during the closure 
period."</p>
<p>Passengers are advised to allow up to 20 minutes extra for their journeys.
