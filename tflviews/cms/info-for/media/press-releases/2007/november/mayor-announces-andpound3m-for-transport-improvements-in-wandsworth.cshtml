<p>The &pound;3m funding includes &pound;662,000 for the London Cycle Network+ for more cycle lanes and better facilities for cyclists in Wandsworth, &pound;300,000 for measures to improve bus services and journey times in St John's Hill and Clapham Junction station, &pound;275,000 for School Travel Plans and &pound;110,000 for environmental improvements to Moyser Road, Tooting, with widened footways, plants and lighting.</p>
<p>The funding is part of the record-breaking five-year &pound;792m programme for local transport schemes included in the Transport for London (TfL)&nbsp;&pound;10bn Investment Programme.</p>
<p>Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone said: "This new &pound;3m investment in local transport schemes will make the daily journeys of people in Wandsworth, safer, greener and more accessible, whether they are travelling by public transport, by car, on foot or by bike.</p>
<p>"Thanks to extra investment in local transport schemes, cycling has increased by 83 per cent since 2000 and more than 1,600 school travel plans have been approved which encourage and enable more children and their parents to walk to school."</p>
<h2>Improving local transport</h2>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said:&nbsp;"This &pound;3m investment will go towards directly improving transport for people in Wandsworth. </p>
<p>"Local people feel strongly about transport in their area and this funding will make a real difference to their experience each day.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>"The investment will fund both large and small projects that will improve bus journeys and access to public transport, reduce congestion, improve the environment and promote a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"This funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in the boroughs to make improvements to local transport."</p>
<p>Projects funded in Wandsworth for 2008/09 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;684,000 for 17 road safety schemes including a project in Clapham Junction to reduce collisions involving pedestrians </li>
<li>&pound;662,000 for the London Cycle Network+ </li>
<li>&pound;300,000 for measures to improve bus services and journey times, including improvements to St John's Hill to create better links and environment around Clapham Junction station.&nbsp; This is a major project with funding from other sections of TfL </li>
<li>&pound;275,000 for School Travel Plans </li>
<li>&pound;110,000 for Moyser Road, a residential street in Tooting.&nbsp; It has long been the wish of an active local "Living Streets" community group to transform the street into the centre of the local community through a new street design. The project would involve a new street design, led by the community who have already drawn up designs for widened footways, plants and lighting </li>
<li>&pound;65,000 to make improvements to crossings for cyclists</li></ul>
