        Tube Lines unable to utilise requested full line closure. Closure on the Jubilee line will be reduced.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>London Underground (LU) has been advised by Tube Lines that they will be not be able to utilise the full weekend closure originally agreed on the Jubilee line this weekend (9 and 10 January).</p>
<p>Tube Lines had originally requested a full line closure for both this Saturday (9 January) and Sunday (10 January), but it will be now be only partly suspended on both days.&nbsp; </p>
<p>On Saturday there will be a service running between North Greenwich and Waterloo and on Sunday a service between Stratford and Waterloo.</p>
<p>This is good news for Tube passengers but does raise concern regarding the delivery of the Jubilee line upgrade.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Despite the fact that Tube Lines have had around 120 weekend or part-weekend closures, compared with an original predicted requirement of around 50, they have repeatedly said that LU has not provided enough access to the line.</p>
<p>LU will continue to support Tube Lines to ensure the upgrade is delivered as soon as possible whilst holding them to account to deliver on their commitments.<br></p>
