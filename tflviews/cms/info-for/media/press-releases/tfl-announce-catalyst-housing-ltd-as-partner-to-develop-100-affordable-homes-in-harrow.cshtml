 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>TfL today announced Catalyst Housing Ltd as its preferred bidder to deliver around 450 homes, all of which will be affordable.</p>

<p>Catalyst is a housing association and a member of the G15 group, with more than 21,000 homes in London and the South East.</p>

<p>Catalyst has been selected to bring the sites forward using the Greater London Authority's 'London Development Panel 2' (LDP2) and will start detailed design and will consult the local community before a planning application is submitted in 2019/20.</p>

<h2>Making journeys easier</h2>

<p>As well as providing new homes, the plans will also improve the public realm with new trees and enhanced pedestrian and cycling connectivity for the local community. TfL plans to retain commuter car parking at the three sites along with the new homes.</p>

<p>TfL will also work with the London Borough of Harrow and local stakeholders to improve the step free access at Stanmore station making journeys easier for thousands of passengers.</p>

<p><strong>Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said</strong>: 'We're delighted to have appointed Catalyst as our partner and look forward to working with them to deliver hundreds of affordable homes at these prime locations next to Tube stations.</p>

<p>'This is another important milestone in our programme across the capital that is delivering thousands of new affordable homes, creating thousands of new jobs and generating vital revenue to reinvest in the transport network.'</p>

<p><strong>Ian McDermott, Chief Executive of Catalyst said</strong>: 'Catalyst is pleased to have been selected by TfL as its partner on the first opportunity to come through the London Development Panel 2 since its creation.</p>

<p>'All three of these schemes will provide 100% genuinely affordable housing for Londoners, and we are really looking forward to working with TfL and Harrow Council to create these new, vibrant communities.'</p>

<p><strong>Cllr Keith Ferry, Deputy Leader of Harrow Council, said</strong>: 'Our community is crying out for affordable homes for Harrow people &#45; so we are delighted to welcome TfL's plans to build a better Harrow.</p>

<p>'Our borough was born out of the need for new homes for hardworking people near railway links &#45; and we are pleased to see that tradition continue today.'</p>

<h2>Unlocking development</h2>

<p>TfL has a programme in place that will see it develop 300 acres to deliver more than 10,000 homes across London.</p>

<p>Sites are being brought to market through a number of different routes and they will play a key role in unlocking development, creating jobs and stimulating economic growth. TfL has already submitted planning applications for more than 4,200 homes, and since May 2016, 50 per cent of its homes have been affordable.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Canons Park Underground Station is served by the Jubilee line and is in Zone 5. The car park currently has 169 parking bays, including five disabled bays. The area of land available for development amounts to 0.39Ha (0.96 acres)</li>
	<li>Rayners Lane Underground Station is served by the Metropolitan line and Piccadilly line and is in Zone 5. The car park currently has 241 parking bays, including six disabled bays. The area of land available for development amounts to 0.97 Ha (2.38 acres)</li>
	<li>Stanmore Underground Station is served by the Jubilee line and is in Zone 5. The car park currently has 450 parking bays, including 12 disabled bays. The area of land available for development amounts to 1.51 ha (3.15 acres)</li>
	<li>An Equality Impact Assessment will be completed as part of any planning process, to ensure the appropriate number of disabled bays are made available during construction and as part of the new scheme</li>
	<li>LDP2 enables TfL to bring forward sites forward with a partner who has a proven track record of delivering housing on public sector land. The GLA has contracted with 29 organisations who make up the LDP2:</li>
</ul>

<p>A2Dominion; Be Living; Bellway; Berkeley Group; Barratt; Catalyst; Countryside Durkan; Engie Consortium (Engie, HUB and Delancey); Galliford Try; Hadley Property Group; Higgins; Hill; Hyde; Lendlease; London and Quadrant Housing Trust; Morgan Sindall Consortium (Morgan Sindall, Muse and Lovell); Native Land; Notting Hill Genesis; Optivo; Peabody; Pinnacle Group; Prospect House Consortium (Stanhope, Network Homes and Laing O'Rourke); Quintain; Redrow; Swan Igloo Consortium (Swan Housing Association and Igloo); Telford Homes; U+I; United Living</p>

<ul>
	<li>This new LDP replaces the first London Development Panel which expired in 2017</li>
	<li>The panel will run for a period of four years, with the potential to extend by one year</li>
	<li>Over its four-year lifespan it is anticipated that the LDP may be used to procure up to &pound;20 billion of Development, measured in GDV.</li>
</ul>

<p>The LDP can offer:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A faster way of selecting a development partner compared to other procurement methods;</li>
	<li>A comprehensive range of development services;</li>
	<li>New flexibilities around how Panel Members can bid in mini-competitions;</li>
	<li>Potential cost savings through its mini-competition process and standardised set of contracts;</li>
	<li>Use for both development and contracting opportunities in Greater London</li>
</ul>
