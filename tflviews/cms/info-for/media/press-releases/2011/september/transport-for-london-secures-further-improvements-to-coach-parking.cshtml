        New times for coach bays on Albert Embankment will make it easier for coach drivers to park and reduce the need to idle.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>From Monday 5 September the operational hours of the existing coach bays on Albert Embankment will be increased, Transport for London (TfL) has announced. </p>
<h2>Parking limit remains</h2>
<p>These bays will now provide short-term parking for coaches between 20:00 and 07:00 in addition to the existing hours of 10:00 to 16:00. </p>
<p>The 20-minute parking limit remains.</p>
<p>This short-term coach parking on Albert Embankment will help coach drivers looking for a place to park before picking up their coach party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Medium and longer term coach parking is available in other areas of the city.</p>
<p>These extended parking hours follow the recent announcement which saw coach parking availability in the Capital increase by 25 per cent. </p>
<h2>Working closely</h2>
<p>Darek Podwiazka, TfL Coach Manager, said: 'With the London 2012 Olympic Games fast approaching and the popularity of coach travel to London continuing to grow, we will continue to work closely with organisations such as Confederation of Passenger Transport (CPT), local boroughs,&nbsp;coach drivers and coach operators to maximise and increase coach parking availability wherever we can.'</p>
