            <p>The Mayor of London today confirmed &pound;5.2m for Bromley to spend on local transport improvements during 2010/11, including &pound;887,000 for essential road maintenance and &pound;925,000 major schemes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bromley has been developing proposals for a number of schemes that it will be financing with the funding package, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;175,000 for cycle training its promotion to children, adults and families to encourage an increase in cycling to school, work and for leisure</li>
<li>&pound;85,000 to upgrade the existing off road Cycle route 76, Addington Road to encourage more active travel</li>
<li>&pound;20,000 to review and de-clutter a pilot area in the borough, providing clearer information for pedestrians and drivers</li>
<li>&pound;10,000 for road safety improvements at the Crossways, Mottingham, including a pedestrian refuge, an improved footway, dropped kerbs and tactile paving</li>
<li>&pound;55,00 to provide educational activities to encourage safety while walking and cycling, including the creation of a website and pupil magazine</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'Even in these tough economic times I am committed to providing this funding to all of London's boroughs. </p>
<p>'The investment means that across the Capital town centres and public spaces are being overhauled, cycling and walking facilities are being improved, and roads are being made safer. </p>
<p>'We have cut red tape to make it easier for borough councils to choose the local transport projects that benefit their residents the most, simplifying the funding system and working together to give local people the improvements they want.</p>
<p>'This time we're also giving an extra focus to cycling - helping to provide the training, cycle parking, and maintenance knowhow to support the introduction of the first two Cycle Superhighways next year.' </p>
<h2>Funding local schemes</h2>
<p>Funding for local schemes is allocated each year by Transport for London.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mayor has simplified the system - reducing the number of funding streams from 23 to five, and introducing fairer funding formulas where needed. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: 'Bromley has identified a range of small and large scale projects that will make a real difference to local people by improving town centres and public spaces, reducing the number of collisions on our roads, improving the environment and promoting greener forms of travel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'Bromley also has the flexibility to move certain funding between projects if, during the course of the year, they find more or less funding is needed for individual schemes.'<br></p><strong>

<p>
<p>Notes to editors</p></strong>
<ul>
<li>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp;While Transport for London allocated funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough</li>
<li>In addition to the usual borough allocation, TfL has included &pound;100,000 for each of the boroughs to spend locally on transport as they choose</li>
<li>Below is a table with a breakdown of Local Implementation Plan funding for Bromley:<br></li></ul>
