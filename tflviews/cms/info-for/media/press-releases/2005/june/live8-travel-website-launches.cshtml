        Transport for London (TfL) today launches an internet microsite with travel information for the Live8 concert.
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The Live8 site will be live by 5pm, Friday.<br><br>As well as the microsite, travel information leaflets will be available across the network. </p>
<p>TfL's usual <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner">Journey Planner </a>service will provide information on the quickest and easiest routes to and from the event on Saturday July 2nd.</p>
<p>Those lucky enough to attend the historic concert in Hyde Park are being encouraged to think carefully about their travel arrangements for the day, and to be patient on what is expected to be a very busy day for those travelling in the Capital.</p>
<p>TfL advises those attending the concert not to drive into central London and to check the Live8 site for all travel information and the last times for public transport home.</p>
