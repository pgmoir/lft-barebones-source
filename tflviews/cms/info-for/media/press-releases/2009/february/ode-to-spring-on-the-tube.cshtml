            <p>The collection of poems celebrates the coming of spring, love - present and past, and a variety of young and old creatures. </p>
<p>For the first time, writer-editor Judith Chernaik - who has been choosing the poems for the Poems on the Underground programme for more than 23 years - has contributed a poem. Tortoise, Chernaik's first and only published poem was originally commissioned for a performance of Saint-Sa&euml;ns's famous piece of classical music Carnival of the Animals.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The other verses are by poets from across the British Isles and beyond and include poems by Gerard Manley Hopkins who was born in Stratford, East London and went to school in Highgate, Andrew Young from Scotland, Welsh poet Menna Elfyn, French poet Jacques Pr&eacute;vert and Belfast poet Paul Muldoon.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Tamsin Dillon, Head of Art on the Underground, said: 'We hope that customers will enjoy the new spring poems and that they will brighten their journey.'</p>
<p>Judith Chernaik, founder of Poems on the Underground, said: 'It's a real privilege to have my only published poem on the Tube. I'm looking forward to seeing how people react to it while on their daily commute.'</p>

<li>London Underground (LU) is undertaking a major programme of renewal as part of Transport for London's (TfL) Investment Programme.&nbsp;This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options.&nbsp;The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future.&nbsp;TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground and DLR passengers to check before they travel at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary. </li></ul>
