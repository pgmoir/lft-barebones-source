<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today announced &pound;2.4m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Tower Hamlets to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.</p>
<p>As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL&nbsp; - up to &pound;168.3m from &pound;161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.</p>
<p>TfL has included &pound;100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses.</p>
<p>The &pound;2.4m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>&pound;277,000 road renewal works on Cambridge Heath Road to repair any uneven surfaces, potholes and cracks. This will improve journeys and safety for all road users </li>
<li>&pound;275,000 to improve cycling provision in the Vyner Street area. Measures will include a contraflow along Bonner Street, traffic calming and junction improvements. This will improve safety for all road users whilst making conditions more pleasant for local residents due to reduced vehicle speeds </li>
<li>&pound;153,000 for a walking improvement scheme on Abbott Road.&nbsp;This will improve accessibility to a newly created open space that is currently partly severed from the local community by Abbott Road.&nbsp;The walking environment will be improved through new, level pavements and better crossing facilities </li>
<li>&pound;150,000 for cycle training and &pound;30,000 for cycle parking improvements </li>
<li>&pound;15,000 to help fund the installation of two Electrical Recharging Points in the borough. They will provide an alternative energy source which aims to improve local air quality for businesses, residents, visitors and fleet operators by assisting in reducing CO2 emissions</li></ul>
<p>Boris Johnson, Mayor of London, said: 'When I was elected I promised I would be different and give greater freedom to the Boroughs.</p>
<p>'This is why this year I have introduced a &pound;100,000 award for Boroughs to spend as they choose. </p>
<p>'Boroughs are being given greater freedom to develop and deliver the schemes they want, which means more choice over a range of key local schemes to improve town centres and cycling facilities, tackle the school run and improve local roads.<br>&nbsp;<br>'I am awarding Tower Hamlets a budget of &pound;2.4m next year for local schemes that will make travelling safer, more accessible and more environment-friendly, helping to improve the quality of life for people across the borough.'<br>&nbsp;<br>Funding for local transport schemes is allocated each year by TfL in response to the applications from boroughs based on their Local Implementation [transport] Plans (LIPs).</p>
<p>Funding is currently available for a wide range of programmes including road safety, maintaining borough roads, tackling the school run, improving walking, cycling and the local environment, making transport more accessible and measures to improve bus journeys.</p>
