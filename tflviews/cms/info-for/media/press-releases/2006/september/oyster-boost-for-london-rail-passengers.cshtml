        London rail passengers received a boost today with the news that Transport for London's (TfL's) Oyster ticketing - including Pay-As-You-Go - will be included as part of the new South Western rail franchise, announced by the Department for Transport.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>TfL Commissioner Peter Hendy said: "We particularly welcome the Department for Transport's stipulation that the new franchise must include Oyster ticketing and validation at all London stations by 2009.</p>
<p>"Today's announcement that the new franchise includes Oyster ticketing and validation is great news for passengers. </p>
<p>"Six million people already use Oyster every day in London. This means that from 2009, passengers on the South West franchise will be able to use Oyster ticketing, including Pay-As-You-Go, integrated with transport modes across London, including the Tube, bus and Docklands Light Railway (DLR).</p>
<p>"It is vital we have an integrated ticketing system between mainline rail and TfL's Tube, bus and DLR network in London, so that passengers can enjoy the full benefits and convenience of Oyster. This is a major step towards fully integrated ticketing in London."<br><br></p>
