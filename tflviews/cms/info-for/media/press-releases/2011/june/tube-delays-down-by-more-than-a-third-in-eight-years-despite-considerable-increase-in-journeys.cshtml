            <p>Delays on London Underground (LU) have dropped by more than a third since 2003/04 when the Tube became part of Transport for London, new figures from TfL show. </p>
<p>The figures were today provided to the London Assembly's Transport Committee, ahead of next week's inquiry into Tube performance.</p>
<p>The figures demonstrate a long-term continuing trend of improvement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Record numbers of passengers per year use the Tube - last year there were 1.1 billion passenger journeys, up 17 per cent since 2003/04 </li>
<li>Rising levels of passenger satisfaction measured by independent surveys </li>
<li>The volume of train service has increased while reliability has improved, since 2003/04 </li>
<li>A 12 per cent improvement in the reliability of LU's scheduled services (measured by the 'excess journey time' experienced on average by passengers) </li>
<li>Delays have fallen by 35 per cent </li>
<li>Despite the vital weekend closures to upgrade the Tube, the number of kilometres operated still remain near their highest ever level</li></ul>
<p>While the data shows that there was a dip in performance during the autumn and winter - due to a number of factors such as the introduction of new systems on the Jubilee and Victoria lines and industrial action - performance has improved over recent months and has returned to the level that was being achieved before the dip.</p>
<p>LU's Managing Director, Mike Brown, said: 'The Tube has an underlying long-term trend of improving performance, which has been achieved despite the need to close parts of the network more frequently at weekends for upgrade work. </p>
<p>'However we are not complacent and we are putting in additional measures to continue to improve our performance and deliver an increasingly reliable service for Londoners.'</p>
