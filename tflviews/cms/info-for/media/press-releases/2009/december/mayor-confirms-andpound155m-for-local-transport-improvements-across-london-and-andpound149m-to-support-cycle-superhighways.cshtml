            <p>The Mayor of London today confirmed &pound;155m for London boroughs to spend on local transport improvements during 2010/11.</p>
<p>The funding is designed to improve local town centres and public spaces, create more shared space and simplify streetscapes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will also increase cycling facilities, support electric vehicles and car clubs, and smooth traffic flow. </p>
<p>TfL is funding hundreds of local schemes next year, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Central London -&nbsp;&pound;935,000 for streetscape and environmental improvements underneath the Westway and outside the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. In addition TfL is providing &pound;6.55m towards the iconic Exhibition Road shared space project in the Capital's museum district and &pound;935,000 for streetscape and environmental improvements underneath the Westway and outside the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital </li>
<li>South London - &pound;1,230,000 for town centre improvements to Clapham Junction to provide a better interchange between transport modes and to provide better access for pedestrians </li>
<li>West London - &pound;840,000 for improvements along the Twickenham Road aimed at smoothing traffic flow, providing improved conditions for cyclists, buses and pedestrians </li>
<li>East London - &pound;250,000 to make road safety improvements in Havering, such as upgrading pedestrian crossings including around schools </li>
<li>North London - &pound;130,000 to extend the existing Covent Garden pilot area for Legible London wayfinding scheme, encouraging more walking between Kings Cross and the Bloomsbury area and Covent Garden area </li></ul>
<p>Alongside Local Implementation Plan (LIP) allocations for cycling projects, the Mayor announced an additional &pound;1.49m of funding for the eight boroughs benefitting from the two pilot Cycle Superhighways being delivered next year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The money has been allocated to provide the appropriate cycle training, parking and maintenance to address the increase in demand from residents living near the new cycling infrastructure, part of the Mayor's cycling revolution in London. </p>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'Even in these tough economic times I am committed to providing this funding to all of London's boroughs. </p>
<p>'The investment means that across the Capital town centres and public spaces are being overhauled, cycling and walking facilities are being improved, and roads are being made safer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'We have cut red tape to make it easier for borough councils to choose the local transport projects that benefit their residents the most, simplifying the funding system and working together to give local people the improvements they want. </p>
<h2>Fairer funding formulas</h2>

<p>'This time we're also giving an extra focus to cycling - helping to provide the training, cycle parking, and maintenance knowhow to support the introduction of the first two Cycle Superhighways next year.'</p>
<p>Funding for local schemes is allocated each year by Transport for London (TfL).</p>
<p>The Mayor has simplified the system - reducing the number of funding streams from 23 to five, and introducing fairer funding formulas where needed.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'The boroughs have identified a range of small and large scale projects that will make a real difference to local people by improving town centres and public spaces, reducing the number of collisions on our roads, improving the environment and promoting greener forms of travel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Boroughs also have the flexibility to move certain funding between projects if, during the course of the year, they find more or less funding is needed for individual schemes.'</p>
<p>The money allocated to boroughs across the funding streams for Cycle Superhighways is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp;While TfL allocated funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough </li>
<li>In addition to the usual borough allocation, TfL has included &pound;100,000 for each of the boroughs to spend locally on transport as they choose </li>
