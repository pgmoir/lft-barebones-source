                        <p>
                            It is our intention to operate this service for the foreseeable future

            <p> The improvements are part of Transport for London's (TfL's) &pound;10bn Investment Programme to meet London's transport needs, now and in the future.</p>
<p>At present, Central line services do not serve Grange Hill, Chigwell and Roding Valley stations after 8pm and have not done so for many years.</p>
<p>A new timetable for the Central line will be introduced later this year on 19 November. </p>
<p>One of the major benefits will be that Tube services will operate between Hainault to Woodford via Roding Valley beyond the current 8pm finishing time until close of passenger service.</p>
<p>Jeff Ellis, General Manager, Central line said: "London Underground is working hard to improve the Tube and constantly monitors customer demand to ensure that our services meet passenger needs. </p>
<p>"The new Central line timetable to be introduced later this year will allow us to respond to growing local demand for later services to run between Hainault and Woodford via Roding Valley. </p>
<p>"It is our intention to operate this service for the foreseeable future and we hope it will prove popular with passengers." <br><br></p>
