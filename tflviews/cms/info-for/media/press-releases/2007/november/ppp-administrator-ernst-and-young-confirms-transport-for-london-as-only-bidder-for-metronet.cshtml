<p>London Underground (LU) Managing Director, Tim O'Toole, and the PPP Administrator of Metronet, Alan Bloom, today confirmed that TfL is the only formal bid to have been received for Metronet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They also confirmed that, as a result of the TfL bid, the PPP Administrator will not take any active steps to market the Metronet companies.</p>
<p>Under TfL's plans, the people and the assets of the two Metronet companies, BCV and SSL, will be transferred into two TfL nominee companies, which will be managed on a stand alone basis while the long-term structure is agreed with the Mayor and Government.</p>
<p>LU Managing Director, Tim O'Toole, said: "An exit from Administration as quickly as possible is the best way to maintain the continued safe operation of the Tube network, to mitigate the performance and cost risks that inevitably come with such a situation, and to ensure the continuation of the Tube's vital upgrade and renewal programme.</p>
<p>"I am pleased to be able to confirm today that Transport for London is the only bidder for Metronet and that we do not anticipate any other bids.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Reliable operation</h2>
<p>"We are now working with the Administrator to transfer the Metronet companies to Transport for London's control in early 2008.</p>
<p>"In dealing with the collapse of Metronet, and through the Administration process, we have had two key priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"First, to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of the Tube network for passengers. That has been achieved and I would like to pay tribute to the hard work and dedication shown by all Metronet and London Underground staff, as well as the Administrator and his team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We need to continue to work together for passengers. </p>
<h2>Efficient structure</h2>
<p>"Secondly, once under Transport for London control, we seek to put in place a stable, economic and efficient structure that is better able to deliver our investment priorities that will lead to increased capacity on the Tube in future."</p>
<p>PPP Administrator, Alan Bloom, said: "Transport for London has expressed clear interest in the purchase of Metronet Rail BCV Limited and Metronet Rail SSL Limited. </p>
<p>"The PPP Administrators will be working closely with Transport for London to progress their proposal towards an exit from administration, preferably early in the New Year."</p>
<p>TfL's bid for the two Metronet companies has been constructed on the basis that there should be no net additional cost to the organisation.<br><br></p>
