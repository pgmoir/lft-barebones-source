<p>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has announced &pound;220m funding for boroughs to deliver transport, town centre and public space improvements to improve the lives of Londoners.</p>
<p>The funding will be used by boroughs across the Capital for a wide range of projects to reduce dangers on the roads, transform local areas, encourage cycling and walking and improve air quality.</p>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) will invest &pound;148m in Local Implementation Plans that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, as well as a further &pound;70m for other schemes, including funding for strategic walking and cycling programmes such as Quietways, Mini-Hollands and Liveable Neighbourhoods.  This will be key to delivering the Mayor's Healthy Streets vision of a city that is more pleasant to live and move around in.</p>
<p>Each of London's 33 boroughs benefits from the funding, with more than &pound;1bn to be invested across TfL's Business Plan to 2021/22, in which the Mayor announced record levels of investment to make cycling easier and safer, including support for borough cycling schemes, and improve the capital's air quality.</p>
<p>This year's Local Implementation Plan funding for boroughs in East London includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Barking &amp; Dagenham - &pound;1.6m to deliver a range of highways, public realm and road safety improvement schemes across the borough;</li>
    <li>Hackney - &pound;2.2m including &pound;250,000 for public realm and cycle safety improvements at key junctions on Green Lanes  and Queensbridge Road</li>
    <li>Havering - &pound;2.3m including &pound;250,000 for Romford Market Place and a new market building. This will involve public realm works, re-paving, tree planting and the introduction of play equipment for children;</li>
    <li>Newham - &pound;2.5m including &pound;200,000 for public realm improvements to reconfigure the junction on Barking Road/Green Street, which will create a new public space with seating and planting;</li>
    <li>Redbridge - &pound;2.5m including &pound;489,000 to complete local safety schemes across the borough to improve road safety;</li>
    <li>Tower Hamlets - &pound;2.5m including &pound;375,000 for a new cycle facility along Manchester Road, an improved north-south link through the central area of the borough with new signage and other cycle improvements.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: &quot;I'm proud that through the new TfL Business Plan we are creating a modern and affordable transport network for the capital, and am delighted that we are able to invest an increased level of funding across the boroughs next year too. By making walking and cycling easier and safer, and funding projects that will improve air quality, we can help boroughs right across the capital to deliver transport and public space improvements that are going to make a real difference to the lives of Londoners.&quot;</p>
<p>Councillor Julian Bell, Chair of London Councils Transport &amp; Environment Committee, said: &quot;London's boroughs welcome this long term settlement by the Mayor of London, which will assist in making borough streets greener and safer. It provides a much needed firm base from which to work with the Mayor and TfL to deliver the improvements to London's local transport scene as part of a city for all Londoners.&quot;</p>
<p>The Mayor and TfL will also work closely with boroughs in the New Year on a stronger offer of support to deliver the projects, and a review of where they are targeted to ensure they are delivered where they are most needed.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown, said: &quot;We will work closer than ever before with all London boroughs to ensure London remains a world-class city with more attractive, accessible and people-friendly streets. Through this funding, Londoners will see real improvements to their local areas, through safer streets, improved public areas, more reliable public transport and increased walking and cycling facilities.&quot;</p>
<p>Significant projects in East London awarded funding last year included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hackney - &pound;250,000 to deliver pedestrian and cycle improvements to the junction and possible removal of staggered crossings on Well Street/Mare Street;</li>
    <li>Havering - &pound;350,000 for improvements to Western Road to support the Romford Leisure Development. Works include widened pavements, new street lights and decluttering to create a pleasant pedestrian environment;</li>
    <li>Newham - &pound;300,000 for corridor improvements to address bus priority and improve pedestrian and cyclist facilities on Upton Lane, High Street North and Greengate Street/Prince Regent Lane corridors;</li>
    <li>Redbridge - &pound;600,000 for the neighbourhoods around Seven Kings and Goodmayes railway including removal of street clutter and improvements to pedestrian, bus and cycle facilities;</li>
    <li>Tower Hamlets &#45; &pound;200,000 to roll out borough wide permanent 20mph speed limits on borough roads.</li>
</ul>
