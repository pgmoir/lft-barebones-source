<p>As the Opening Ceremony marks the start of the London 2012 Olympic Games, the first road event will be taking place tomorrow (Saturday 28 July) going through London and Surrey. </p>
<p>Huge crowds are also expected to line the streets of London and Surrey tomorrow to support Tour de France hero Bradley Wiggins and his team mates Chris Froome and Mark Cavendish as they aim to land Team GB's first gold medal of the Games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The men's cycling road race is the first of the London 2012 Games road events, all of which will see temporary road closures and parking restrictions. Viewing capacity in central London will be very limited.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Events will also be taking place across the capital at the Olympic Park and other venues in London.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Spectators will be travelling to the Olympic Park, ExCeL, North Greenwich Arena, Greenwich Park, Royal Artillery Barracks, Horse Guards Parade, Earls Court, The Mall, Lord's Cricket Ground, Wimbledon and Wembley Arena.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE, said: 'As well as it being the first of the road events, which will see Bradley Wiggins and Team GB cycling through London and Surrey, other Olympic events will get underway in the Capital. </p>
<p>'Public transport will be exceptionally busy tomorrow as people make their way to watch the cycling and to the venues. </p>
<p>'Millions of Londoners have already planned their journeys at GetAheadoftheGames.com but for anyone who hasn't already done so, I would encourage them to do this and make sure they leave extra time for any journeys.'</p>
