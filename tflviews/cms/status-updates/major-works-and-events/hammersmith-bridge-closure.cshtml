      <h2>Bridge closure</h2>

<p>Hammersmith Bridge is closed to motor&nbsp;traffic&nbsp;until major safety-critical strengthening work is completed. There are diversions for motorists via Chiswick Bridge and Putney Bridge.</p>

<p>The bridge remains open for walking and cycling.</p>

<p>The closure will last until major refurbishment works to the 132-year-old bridge are complete. We are working with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lbhf.gov.uk/hot-topics/hammersmith-bridge-repairs">Hammersmith and Fulham</a>&nbsp;Council to confirm the final plan for this work as soon as possible.</p>

<p>We want to hear your views on <a href="/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/hammersmith-bridge">proposals for a temporary walking and cycling bridge</a>.</p>

<h2>Buses</h2>

<p>We have made these changes to the local bus network.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Routes 33, 72, 209,&nbsp;and 485 are&nbsp;running shortened or altered routes</li>
	<li>A new route, route 533 is running between Barnes and Hammersmith via Chiswick Bridge</li>
	<li>Route 419 has been extended from Barnes Pond to Roehampton, Bessborough Road. The full route is now Richmond station to Roehampton, Bessborough Road. Buses run every 12 minutes on Monday to Saturday and every 20 minutes on Sundays</li>
</ul>

<p>The&nbsp;changes are designed to:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Provide or enhance direct links between Roehampton, Mortlake, Barnes and the Tube network at Putney Bridge</li>
	<li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Retain a direct link between Barnes, Mortlake and Hammersmith, where there is step-free access to the Tube</li>
	<li style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;">Reinstate route 72 to its full length north of the river so it again runs between Hammersmith and East Acton</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bus alternatives</h3>

<p>Route 265 connects with Putney Bridge station for the District line. Route 220 connects Putney Bridge with Hammersmith.</p>

<p>Route 337 connects with East Putney station for the District line.</p>

<p>Bus routes which normally run across Chiswick Bridge and Putney Bridge continue to do so.</p>

<p>It&nbsp;takes approximately&nbsp;15-20 minutes to walk between the bus stops in Castelnau or Lonsdale Road on the&nbsp;southern side&nbsp;of the river&nbsp;and Hammersmith bus station&nbsp;across Hammersmith Bridge.</p>

<h2>Drivers and deliveries</h2>

<p>There are diversions via Chiswick Bridge and Putney Bridge. Delays on the diversion routes and other roads in the area are expected.</p>

<p>Find an alternative route and river crossing where possible.</p>

<p>For the latest information on how London roads are operating, see our <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/traffic/status">traffic status updates map.</a></p>

<h2>Bridge repair works</h2>

<p>Work is currently expected to take around three years. TfL has allocated &pound;25m to ensure design work could begin straight away, and to allow vital preliminary works to take place in November 2019.</p>
