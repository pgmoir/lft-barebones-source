            <p>Lance Joseph, 22, of Hailsham Avenue, Streatham, was sentenced yesterday (November 3) at Camberwell Magistrates Court.</p>
<p>The incident took place last year on September 24 2004, when Revenue Protection Inspectors boarded a 436 bus.</p>
<p>One inspector had asked Joseph for his ticket, whereupon he was subject to threatening and abusive language and behaviour. </p>
<p>A TfL spokesperson said: 'We are pleased that the court has judged this case as seriously as we have and given a custodial sentence. </p>
<p>'Transport for London will not tolerate staff being verbally or physically abused.</p>
<p>'They are entitled to be able to carry out their work without the fear of threats and violence.'</p>
<p>Joseph was found guilty of using threatening and abusive language and behaviour.</p>
<p>He was also found guilty of two breaches of the public service vehicle regulations, having no ticket and giving false details. </p>
