<ul>
<li>Countdown - a message will be displayed on Countdown signs at affected bus stops from today (Friday), giving passengers advance warning of Monday's strike, and will be displayed all day on Monday 
</li><li>Publicity - signs will be displayed at bus stops, shelters and stations, which will include directions to the nearest alternative means of transport 
</li><li>Travel information - customers can contact our travel information team by phone, on 020 7222 1234, for up-to-date information and advice on alternative means of transport. As lines are likely to be busy, we advise customers with internet access to visit our <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner">online journeyplanner</a> 
</li><li>Additional staff - extra staff members will be out on the network on Monday, concentrating on the busiest stations and stops, to offer advice and guidance to passengers. Staff will also be driving along bus routes with no service to offer advice to passengers.<br><br></li></ul>
