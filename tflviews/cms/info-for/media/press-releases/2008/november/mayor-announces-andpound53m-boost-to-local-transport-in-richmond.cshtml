<p>The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced &pound;5.3m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Richmond upon Thames to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to &pound;168.3m from &pound;161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.</p>
<p>TfL has included &pound;100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses. </p>
<p>The &pound;5.3m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;1.3m to support borough's raft of comprehensive town centre improvements in Richmond.&nbsp;Measures proposed include the introduction of a 20mph zone to improve safety.&nbsp;Improvements for pedestrians include repaving and lighting, improved signage and better crossing points.&nbsp;The investment also includes enhancements to the public realm outside Richmond station </li>
<li>&pound;739,000 road renewal works on Mortlake High Street to repair any uneven surfaces, potholes and cracks.&nbsp;This will improve journeys and safety for all road users </li>
<li>&pound;70,000 for cycle training and &pound;15,000 for cycle parking improvements </li>
<li>&pound;50,000 to help fund the installation of six electrical recharging points in the borough. They will provide an alternative energy source which aims to improve local air quality for businesses, residents, visitors and fleet operators by assisting in reducing CO2 emissions</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'When I was elected I promised I would be different and give greater freedom to the boroughs.</p>
<p>'This is why this year I have introduced a &pound;100,000 award for boroughs to spend as they choose. </p>
<p>'Boroughs are being given greater freedom to develop and deliver the schemes they want, which means more choice over a range of key local schemes to improve town centres and cycling facilities, tackle the school run and improve local roads.<br>&nbsp;<br>'I am awarding Richmond a budget of &pound;5.3m next year for local schemes that will make travelling safer, more accessible and more environment-friendly, helping to improve the quality of life for people across the borough.'</p>
<p>Funding for local transport schemes is allocated each year by TfL in response to the applications from boroughs based on their Local Implementation [transport] Plans (LIPs). </p>
<p>Funding is currently available for a wide range of programmes including road safety, maintaining borough roads, tackling the school run, improving walking, cycling and the local environment, making transport more accessible and measures to improve bus journeys.</p>

<li>Each London borough has a LIP approved by the Mayor containing proposals to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp;While TfL&nbsp;allocates funding for individual schemes, LIP and individual project delivery is the responsibility of each borough</li>
<li>A school travel plan is a package of measures, tailored to the needs of individual schools to deliver alternative transport methods for the school run, aiming to reduce single occupancy car journeys to school, cut congestion and increase safety near schools</li>
<li>Priorities for LIPs include:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Improving road safety </li>
<li>Encouraging walking and cycling </li>
<li>Improving bus journey times and reliability</li>
<li>Relieving traffic congestion and improving journey time reliability </li>
<li>Improving the working of parking and loading arrangements </li>
