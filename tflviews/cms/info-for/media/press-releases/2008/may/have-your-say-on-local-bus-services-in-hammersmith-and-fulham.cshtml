            <p>The proposed new route 228 has been developed in partnership with Hammersmith &amp; Fulham Council and the Royal Borough of Kensington &amp; Chelsea meeting long standing requests for new transport links.</p>
<p>It would operate between Central Middlesex Hospital (in Park Royal) and Elgin Avenue, via White City, Ladbroke Grove and Harrow Road.</p>
<p>An associated change is proposed for the route 316 which currently operates between Cricklewood (Edgware Road) and St. Charles Hospital.</p>
<p>There are plans to extend the route from St. Charles Hospital to White City along St. Mark's Road and St. Ann's Road.</p>
<p>The extension will provide a high frequency link between North Kensington and the areas around Latimer Road, and White City, as well as providing links from Queen's Park, Kilburn High Road, Brondesbury and Cricklewood.</p>
<p>Both routes will use single-deck buses and provide new bus links to White City and the new Westfield Development.</p>
<p>Peter Bradley, Head of Stakeholder Engagement, said: 'London's bus network is constantly under review to ensure we continue to meet passenger needs.'</p>
<p>'We are very keen to hear passengers' views on our proposals for local bus services.'</p>
<p>Further information about the proposals can be accessed through <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/busrouteconsultation">www.tfl.gov.uk/busrouteconsultation</a> and also from London Buses Customer Services.</p>
<p>The consultation will run from 26 May until 11 July 2008.</p>
