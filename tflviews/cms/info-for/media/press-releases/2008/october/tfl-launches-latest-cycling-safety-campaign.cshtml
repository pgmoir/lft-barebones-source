        Transport for London (TfL) urges cyclists and motorists to watch out for each other on London's roads.

<p>TfL's latest Cycling Safety campaign can be seen in cinemas throughout London from this week.</p>
<p>Adverts carrying the stark message 'It's easy to miss what you're not looking for. Look out for cyclists', will play before some of the autumn's most hotly anticipated films including 'How to Lose Friends and Alienate People' and 'Quantum of Solace'.</p>
<p>The campaign, which will also include print advertising and online activity, follows a number of fatal cycling accidents that took place in London last month. </p>
<p>TfL continues to work to make cycling safer in London.</p>
<p>Every year, goods vehicles are involved in more than half of all cycling fatalities in the Capital.</p>
<h2>Safety lenses distributed</h2>
<p>To address this serious road safety issue, TfL distributed 10,000 free Fresnel safety lenses to freight companies operating vehicles in London earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The lenses, which stick onto the passenger side-window of the lorry, improve the driver's vision of cyclists that pass alongside the nearside of their vehicles.</p>
<p>TfL recently ordered an additional 10,000 Fresnel lenses which will be distributed to goods vehicle operators over the coming weeks. </p>
<p>Work is also taking place to ensure cyclists take every precaution to avoid potential dangers on the road. Transport for London is investing a record &pound;3m on cycle training in 2008/09 for Londoners of all ages, through London's borough councils.</p>
<h2>Cycle training</h2>
<p>The training sessions are tailored to each individual's needs and will teach them to deal with the wide range of traffic conditions on the Capital's streets.</p>
<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'London is a terrific city for cycling and it is generally a safe place to cycle.</p>
<p>'But the greatest danger to cyclists is complacency and that is why cycle safety campaigns are so important.</p>
<p>'I want our city to be a cyclist's paradise but I am fully aware that prospective pedallers will not take to two wheels unless they feel safe.</p>
<p>'That is why reducing accidents is a priority and I hope this campaign will contribute to that aim.'</p>
<h2>Building confidence</h2>
<p>David Brown, Managing Director of Surface Transport for TfL, said: 'While the cinema adverts focus on drivers, to remind them to actively keep a look out for cyclists, there is also a great deal that cyclists can do to make themselves safer.</p>
<p>'Cycling training is now available throughout London and is a great way of building up confidence and learning valuable safety tips from the experts.</p>
<p>'Everyone from complete beginners to experienced riders can benefit from the training, which is why we are investing heavily in the scheme.'</p>
