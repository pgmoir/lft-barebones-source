                            We have funded the recruitment of an extra 200 British Transport Police officers for the Tube, an increase of 50 per cent.

            <p>The issue was resolved completely yesterday at a meeting between London Underground and Aslef.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for LU said: "We are pleased that we have reached resolution and the planned industrial action has now been called off.</p>
<p>"The safety of passengers and staff is our top priority. </p>
<p>"London Underground has done, and continues to do, a huge amount to successfully tackle anti-social behaviour on the east end of the District line and across the Tube network as a whole.</p>
<p>"We have funded the recruitment of an extra 200 British Transport Police (BTP) officers for the Tube, an increase of 50 per cent.</p>
<p>"Recent joint London Underground and BTP initiatives on the east end of the District line have had notable success, in some cases cutting crime and anti-social behaviour by up to a third. </p>
<p>"A number of arrests have been made recently. </p>
<p>"Further joint operations are planned throughout the half-term break."<br></p>
