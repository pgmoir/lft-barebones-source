            <li>Take
            part to be in with a chance to win some
            fantastic prizes including a prime spot at the Tour de France Stage 3 finish
            line on Monday 7 July</li>
            <li>The London Cycle Challenge will have three stages
            over the summer, both before and after the Tour de France returns to London</li>
        </ul>
        <p>With just over a month to go,
        Transport for London (TfL) has launched its London Cycle Challenge to get more
        people out on their bikes and excited about the Tour de France's thrilling return to the
        capital on Monday 7 July</p>
        <p>The first stage, the Virtual
        Ride Challenge is now open, and will run until 27 June.
        </p>
        <p>This challenge
        allows Londoners to virtually ride the first three stages of the Tour de
        France. Riders can get
        together a group of friends to make a team, and log all bike journeys which
        will add up and move your virtual bike along the route of the first three
        stages of the Tour. Get the bike to the finish line on The Mall in St James's
        Park and you could be
        in with a chance to win a place there to watch the world's best riders on
        Monday 7 July. </p>
        <p>There are many other prizes available through the London Cycle
        Challenge including signed Team GB cycling kit and membership for Barclays
        Cycle Hire. </p>
        <p>Registration is now open and it's free to participate, go to www.tfl.gov.uk/cyclechallenge
        to find out more information and get involved.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Ben Plowden, Director of Surface
        Strategy and Planning at TfL, said: &quot;The London Cycle Challenge is a great
        opportunity to show how simple and fun cycling can be. With the excitement of
        the Tour de France Stage 3 finishing in London on Monday 7 July, the annual
        Prudential RideLondon weekend following in August and the Tour of Britain in
        September, the Challenge is a great way for everyone to get involved.
        &nbsp; It's aimed at all levels, from
        those who don't own a bike, to those who regularly cycle to work, there really
        is something in it for everyone with some great prizes on offer. So whether
        this will be your first time on a bike, if you're a lapsed rider, or a seasoned
        commuter, the emphasis is simply to give it a try.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The Tour de France &#45; the world's largest annual
        sporting event &#45; comes to London on Monday 7 July after the first two stages in
        Yorkshire. </p>
        <p>Around 200 elite cyclists will travel from Cambridge, through Essex,
        into London before a spectacular finish on The Mall. </p>
        <p>The iconic Tour de France
        will draw people onto the streets of London from near and far, and help to
        inspire more people to take up cycling.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The London Cycle Challenge is another way for Londoners
        to get into
        the spirit of the Tour de
        France. Last
        weekend, more
        than 3000 people took part in the Fete du Tour celebration
        of cycling at Queen Elizabeth Park (QEOP). </p>
        <p>Nearly a thousand adults and
        children rode a range of bikes, including mini penny farthings, tandems,
        choppers and recumbent bikes, and hundreds of cyclists had their bikes security
        marked and sat in a lorry cab to understand blind spots.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>QEOP will play a major role in the
        Tour when spectators will be able to watch the elite cycling action in the
        official Tour de France Fan Parks.&nbsp; In addition to QEOP, there will be Fan Parks
        at Green Park and Trafalgar Square. The Fan Park sites will feature a range of different
        activities and live Tour de France racing on a big screen.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Once the Tour de France has
        left the capital, the London Cycle
        Challenge will continue
        with two more challenges -&nbsp; the Workplace Challenge and the Goal Setting Challenge &#45;
        helping to keep Londoners in
        the saddle all summer. For more information go to www.tfl.gov.uk/cyclechallenge.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>An extensive programme of
        public engagement&nbsp;and communication around the arrival of the Tour de
        France in the capital is underway to help businesses and the public plan and
        get around on the day. The engagement activities include leaflet drops to
        residents and businesses along the route, work with the local boroughs, local
        business engagement events and public information sessions. Last week TfL
        published detailed travel advice to help Londoners prepare for the Tour,
        including maps showing affected roads. For more information, detailed maps and
        a range of advice, go to tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The Cycle Challenge
            focuses on participation, rather than miles cycled and there will be prizes
            for:&nbsp; the 'top encourager' (the person who gets the most people involved
            in the Cycle Challenge), the team who complete the virtual ride the quickest,
            employers with the most participants in the Workplace Challenge and there will
            be spot prizes for teams that complete the ride and people that complete their
            personal goals.
            &nbsp; </li>
            <li>A School Cycle Challenge is also open and running until
            27 June to encourage schools to cycle more often. School can register
            teams to compete against other schools across London. School staff will be
            able to start signing pupils up for the competition, by logging into the
            STARS website: http://www.staccreditation.org.uk/school/staccreditation.php</li>
            <li>The detailed Tour de
            France route is available on the TfL website at tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance. To
            avoid delays drivers are advised to, wherever possible, avoid areas&nbsp;near
            the event routes in the affected parts of Cambridgeshire, Essex and London. For
            up to date information on how transport services are operating, check before
            you travel at tfl.gov.uk and follow
            &#64;TfLTravelAlerts (Tube, DLR and London Overground), &#64;TfLTrafficNews (roads) and
            &#64;TfLBusAlerts (bus).
            &nbsp; </li>
            <li>Tube and Rail will be the best
            way to get around the affected areas of London, with the vast majority of
            services in central London running as normal. The Circle and District
            lines are expected to be extremely busy as will stations along the route,
            particularly in Zone 1 from midday until around 18:00</li>
            <li>The Tour de France
            will kick off a spectacular summer of cycling in London, with the exciting
            event followed by Prudential RideLondon on the 9 and 10 August and then the
            Tour of Britain, which finishes in the capital on 14 September</li>
            <li>The Tour de France
            is the world's largest annual sporting event and covers approximately 3,500kms.
            A worldwide television audience of 3.5billion people watch the event annually.
            There will be 190 countries broadcasting the Tour de France and there are 5,000
            hours of TV coverage annually. The last time the Tour visited England was in
            2007 when London hosted the Grand D&eacute;part, which is the
            opening of the race</li>
            <li>This summer's
            cycling events are likely to inspire thousands more Londoners to take to two
            wheels, building on the Mayor's ambition for cycling to be an integral part of
            the transport network. As part of his cycling vision, the Mayor is already
            engaging in a vast &pound;1billion programme of improvements&nbsp; - creating a
            series of enhanced cycling superhighways, urban 'quietways' for more cautious
            cyclists, and turning some outer boroughs into mini-Hollands</li>
            <li>For more information
            on the Mayor's Vision for Cycling visit http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/vision-for-cycling</li>
            <li>The Mayor is
            committed to ensuring London retains its status as the world capital of sport,
            and has recently set up the Major Events Oversight Board. The board is chaired
            by Sir Edward Lister, and comprises of TfL, the emergency services and other
            key partner agencies. It provides strategic direction and advice to the Mayor
            on the approach to bidding, staging and evaluating major events in London. The
            board ensures that all major road events continue to be carefully considered
            and tightly managed to ensure everyone gets full benefit from the event without
            undue impact on Londoners and London's transport. The board also looks at ways
            to ensure the major events programme is effectively communicated with
            Londoners, visitors, businesses and stakeholders to allow sufficient notice and
            forward planning for everyone.
