            <li>Sixty New Routemaster bus sculptures,
            painted and adorned by well-known and aspiring artists, on show in London this
            autumn</li>
            <li>Displayed at prominent locations across
            the capital from 20 October for seven weeks</li>
            <li>Buses will be auctioned for charity
            later this year
            &nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Up to 60 New Routemaster bus
        sculptures will be unveiled across London this October as part of
        celebrations to mark the Year of the Bus.
        &nbsp;
        The bus sculptures, which
        are 2.5m long, 1m high and 0.5m wide, will be painted and adorned by well-known
        and aspiring artists to showcase the vital role that London's buses play in the
        life and economy of the city and the UK as a whole.
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        Londoners and visitors to
        the city will get the chance to discover the bus sculptures, which will be
        organised in clusters, on foot by following public art trails in five areas of
        the capital &#45; three in central London and two in outer London.&nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The sculpture trail is part
        of Transport for London (TfL's) celebrations to mark the Year of the Bus in
        partnership with London Transport Museum and the capital's bus operators, and
        is being delivered with creative events company Wild in Art.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Over 100
        submissions from artists and designers have been received and an event was
        staged last night at London Transport Museum to match artists with sponsors.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The project will be entirely
        funded by individuals and organisations sponsoring the bus sculptures, with the
        Year of the Bus Sculpture Trail running from Monday 20 October for seven
        weeks.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>At the end of the event, the bus sculptures will be brought
        together in a final display before being auctioned, with all proceeds split
        between three charities: Kids Company, Transaid and London Transport Museum.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Leon Daniels, TfL's Managing
        Director for Surface Transport, said: &quot;These sculpture trails will give
        Londoners and visitors to the city an exciting opportunity to discover original
        artwork on foot in both central and outer London locations.&nbsp; The project
        also seeks to remind everyone of the key role that London's buses play in the
        lives of so many millions of people in this city.&nbsp; The New Routemaster is
        already famed for its asymmetrical geometry, curves and flowing lines &#45; I'm
        delighted that this sculpture trail will see the iconic London bus transformed
        into multiple works of art across the city.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Charlie Langhorne, Director
        of Wild in Art, said: &quot;We are thrilled to be working with Transport for London
        on the creation of the Year of the Bus Sculpture Trail. Our events are designed
        to bring the enjoyment of public art to hundreds of thousands of people while
        offering new ways to explore a host city. It will be a fantastic spectacle and
        is an excellent way to raise vital funds for Kids Company, Transaid and London
        Transport Museum.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Events and activities are
        being held throughout 2014 to celebrate the role that London buses, bus drivers
        and the staff who support them play in keeping the capital moving, and mark a
        number of important anniversaries.&nbsp; These include 60 years since the
        creation of the original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of
        its predecessor the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses
        were sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World
        War.
        There's
        still time for businesses wanting to be part of the Year of the Bus Sculpture
        Trail to sponsor one of the buses.&nbsp; Interested organisations should email yearofthebus&#64;tfl.gov.uk to find out more.
        The
        Year of the Bus is supported by and delivered in partnership with Exterion
        Media, Abellio, Arriva London, Clear Channel UK, Go-Ahead London, Metroline,
        RATP Dev UK, Stagecoach, Wrightbus, Optare and Telent Technology Services.

            buses carry 6.5m passengers a day&nbsp;and, alongside the Tube &#45; which
            carries around 4m each day &#45; provide the backbone of London's transport
            network.&nbsp; It's one of the largest bus networks anywhere&nbsp;in the world,
            with a 8,600-strong bus fleet, operating across around 700 routes serving
            19,500 bus stops.&nbsp; Despite its size, the bus network remains flexible and
