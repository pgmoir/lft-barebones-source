            <p>Maida Vale Tube station has won a National Railway Heritage award for the modernisation of the station which was built in 1915. </p>
<p>The prize was presented by Lord Andrew Adonis, Secretary of State for Transport at the Merchant Taylor's Hall in London on 2 December 2009.</p>
<p>The Grade II listed building came top in the London Regional Category at the National Awards for modernisation of a heritage station. </p>
<p>The award recognises the work London Underground has done to restore the many original heritage features such as the large attractive mosaics of the famous Tube logo or 'roundel', red terracotta facade and the extensive tiled wall finishes. </p>
<h2>Historic stations</h2>
<p>Richard Parry, Managing Director for London Underground (LU), said: 'This award highlights the hard work by our staff to maintain the history of the station at the same time as modernising it to a high standard for the thousands of people that use the Tube everyday.'</p>
<p>Mike Ashworth, Design and Heritage Manager for London Underground, said: 'Heritage is a huge part of London Underground's identity and keeping historical features, while introducing modern requirements that improve our stations, is very important to us and to our customers.'</p>
<p>New CCTV, an improved public address system and tactile strips on platforms have also been installed at Maida Vale, which is on the Bakerloo line, as part of Transport for London's multi-billion-pound Investment Programme.</p>
<p>White City Tube station and Earl's Court Tube station were also shortlisted at the awards and both received certificates of merit in respect of the modernisation works undertaken at these historic stations.</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>LU&nbsp;is undertaking a major programme of renewal as part of Transport for London's multi-billion Investment Programme.&nbsp;This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options.&nbsp;The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future.&nbsp;TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground and Docklands Light Railway passengers to 'check before you travel' at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary. <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/">Weekend travel news</a> is available online </li>
<li>The LU sponsored award for Accessibility and Heritage was won by Irish Rail for their restoration and extension at Hazelhatch &amp; Celbridge station on the Dublin suburban system </li>
