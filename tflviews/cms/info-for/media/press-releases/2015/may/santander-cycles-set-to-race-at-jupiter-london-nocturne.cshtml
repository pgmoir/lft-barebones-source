        One month to go until night time cycle hire race returns to Smithfield Market
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Following a thrilling cycle hire race last year, Transport for London (TfL) has again teamed up with Jupiter London Nocturne to give Londoners the chance to compete in an exciting twilight race on Santander Cycles.</p>
<p>Cycle hire enthusiasts will join some famous faces to race around the 1.1km route during the evening of Saturday 6 June, pedalling as fast as they can around the iconic Smithfield Market before an epic race to the finish line.  The Santander Cycles race is part of the 9th annual Jupiter London Nocturne - a series of sprint and endurance cycling races enjoyed by over 15,000 spectators in east London each year.</p>
<p>To be in with a chance to win a place in the race, Londoners will be asked to 'show their race face' and post a photo of themselves on a Santander Cycles on TfL's Facebook page or at TfL's Twitter account. The winner of the race will receive a year's free Santander Cycles membership</p>
<p>James Mead, General Manager of Santander Cycles at TfL, said: `Our new red Santander Cycles have already become a familiar sight around the Capital, and we are delighted that they will be involved in the Jupiter London Nocturne.</p>
<p>`Last year's race was one of the standout events of the night. While only a handful of people will be lucky enough to compete in the race, anyone can hire one of our Santander Cycles from one of 750 docking stations across central London.  I'm sure, like last year, this race will encourage even more people to use the scheme to ride around London for commuting or leisure.'</p>
<p>James Pope, CEO of FACE Partnership, said: `The Jupiter London Nocturne is about celebrating cycling in London in all its different forms so we are excited to include the Cycle Hire Race once again this year. The peloton of Santander Cycles is sure to get the biggest cheers from the Nocturne crowds so it's going to be a fantastic experience for the competitors who are lucky enough to win a place.'</p>
<p>Massimo Saetta, who competed in the event last year and is returning this year, said: `I think these bikes are as iconic as the black cab and the red bus. It's just the best way to get around London so I'm very pleased to return to the 1.1km Smithfield Market course this year and have a go at racing them!  Last year was just so much fun and the crowds were fantastic! If there is one bike race to win this year, it's this one! It's the only race where all the riders get to leave their real bikes at home. And on the day it's all about who has the legs for that more than 60kph sprint at the end! Am I ready? Yes, I cannot wait!'</p>
<p>Jupiter London Nocturne attracts a buzzing atmosphere, with spectators able to take in the festival feel which includes a cycling expo area, food stalls and live music. A number of Santander Cycles docking stations are located close to the event at Smithfield Market and spectators will be able to visit the Santander Cycles roadshow at the event. Visitors to the stand can pick up a free docking station map and ask staff any questions they may have about the cycle hire scheme.</p>
<p>Santander Cycles is the second-largest cycle hire scheme in the Western world, covering 100km2 with docking stations located every 300m and more than 10,000 bikes to hire from as little as &pound;2 per day. Since it was introduced in 2010, around 40 million journeys have been made using the bikes, making it a popular and affordable way to travel around London for work or leisure.</p>
<p>Usage of the scheme rose by a quarter last year and is at a record high, with more than 10 million journeys made in 2014. Customer satisfaction is also at an all-time high, with over 80 per cent of members intending to renew their membership.</p>
<p>As well as the Jupiter London Nocturne, there will be more exciting cycling events in London this year. Later this summer, Prudential RideLondon will return to the Capital's roads on 1 and 2 August and the Aviva Tour of Britain will once again finish on the streets of London on 13 September. The mix of elite and fun, and mass participation rides this year in the Capital are likely to inspire thousands more Londoners to two wheels, building on TfL's ambition for cycling to be an integral part of the transport network. TfL is currently investing &pound;4bn into a radical programme of change for the Capital's roads, creating a series of major new segregated cycle routes, enhanced cycle superhighways, urban Quietways and turning outer London boroughs into 'mini-Hollands'.</p>
