        Arsenal station is closed for two weeks until March 3 as further modernisation works take place as part of Transport for London's &pound;10bn Investment Programme.
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The work is being undertaken by Tube Lines. </p>
<p>
<p>The closure will allow Tube Lines to safely replace a portion of the roof over the gate line in the ticket hall and carry out works to finish the new control room and replace the entrance canopy.</p>
<p>New electrical and communication systems will also be tested.</p>
<p>Mike Challis, Piccadilly line General Manager, said: 'The majority of the heavy works undertaken during previous closures is now complete and the new electrical and communication systems are being brought into use.</p>
<p>'Tiling work is well advanced with the historic 'Gillespie Road' tiles re-installed and new lighting now operating on the westbound platform.</p>
<p>'The rest of the new platform and passageway lighting will be operating shortly.</p>
<p>'The installation of the new public address, cameras and Help points systems is also well advanced. </p>
<p>
<h2>Heritage features</h2>
<p>
<p>'Whilst the focus is to provide a station featuring modern information and security systems, we are using the opportunity presented by the station modernisation to restore and repair station heritage features for future generations.</p>
<p>'However, it has become necessary to dispose of some of the original tiling due to its very poor condition.</p>
<p>'Due to large amounts of mortar still attached to the tiling it means that it is impossible to restore the tiles, use them elsewhere or recycle them.</p>
<p>'Instead, the original tiles will be replicated as has been done successfully in several stations such as St John's Wood.'</p>
<p>
<h2>Valid tickets accepted</h2>
<p>
<p>Further modernisation works will continue throughout the year.</p>
<p>During the closure, passengers should allow an extra 15 minutes to complete their journeys.</p>
<p>Passengers travelling to Arsenal station are advised to walk the short distance from Finsbury Park station to Arsenal (around 10 minutes) or travel to Finsbury Park and use local buses 4, 19 or 236 to bus stop EL on Blackstock Road and then walk along Gillespie Road (approximately seven minutes).</p>
<p>Valid London Underground tickets will be accepted on these journeys. <br></p>
