<p>The Olympic Torch Relay has arrived in London and the Capital's transformation into a massive sporting and cultural venue gathers pace.&nbsp; </p>
<p>With only four days to go to the Opening Ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games, it is time to put Games-time travel plans into action.</p>
<p>Central London, the ORN, areas around venues and the Torch Relay will be exceptionally busy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Up to one million extra visitors are expected in London every day during the Games, making an additional three million journeys over and above the usual 12 million daily journeys on public transport.</p>
<p><strong>TfL's key travel advice</strong> (Tuesday, 24 July):</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical changes to the road network have been carried out to ensure that the ORN is ready to begin operation from 6:00 on Wednesday 25 July.&nbsp;Avoid central London, around the ORN, venues and the route of the Torch Relay </li>
<li>If you have to drive, plan ahead, consider re-timing your journey and allow more time </li>
<li>Experience from around the UK shows that very large and enthusiastic crowds will welcome the Torch as it travels through the Capital </li>
<li>If you are planning to view the Torch, stay local - the Torch is passing through every London borough so try to view it when it passes through an area close to your home or work </li>
<li>On public transport, avoid stations that are on or close to the Torch Relay routes.&nbsp; These stations will be exceptionally busy up to two hours before and at least one hour after the Torch passes </li>
<li>Cultural events are taking place across London today, see <a href="http://www.molpresents.com">www.molpresents.com</a> for further information. If possible, avoid these areas if you are not attending an event </li>
<li>Before travelling, check out live travel updates at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk">tfl.gov.uk</a> or by following &#64;TfLTravelAlerts (Tube, DLR and London Overground) or &#64;TfLTrafficNews (roads) </li>

<p><strong>Olympic Torch Relay route</strong> (Tuesday 24 July):</p>
<ul>
<li>The Olympic Torch Relay has started its week long journey through every one of London's 33 boroughs </li>
<li>On Tuesday 24 July, it will be mainly in south west and west London, travelling from Hook Community Centre (at approximately&nbsp;8:20) to Walpole Park (18:50) through Kingston-upon-Thames, Richmond-upon-Thames, Hounslow, Hillingdon and Ealing</li></ul>
<p><strong>Spectators of the Torch Relay</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crowds are expected at Kingston-upon-Thames in the morning and at Kew Bridge around midday </li>
<li>If you're planning to view the Torch in one of these locations, expect crowds and be prepared to wait</li></ul>
<p><strong>Public Transport</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Piccadilly line between Hounslow West and Hounslow East is likely to be busy throughout the day, as spectators use this service to travel to the Torch route </li>
<li>South Ealing and Ealing Broadway stations are expected to be exceptionally busy between 18:00-19:00. If possible, consider using alternative stations to avoid the crowds</li></ul>
<p><strong>Roads</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Torch road route is as follows: A243 (Hook Road) - A307 (Richmond Road) - A315 (London Road) - A437 (Dawley Road) - A4020 (Uxbridge Road) </li>
<li>Kingston-upon-Thames town centre will be busy in the morning peak. If possible avoid the area at this time </li>
<li>Kew Bridge is likely to be congested before and after the torch passes at 11:15. If possible consider retiming your journey to avoid this area </li>
<li>Significant planned changes to London's road network to build the ORN made over the weekend mean that, as expected, some journeys into London will take significantly longer than usual. In particular, there are lane restrictions in the following locations which drivers should avoid: A40 Hangar Lane as part of the ORN for Wembley; A3 Tibbet's Corner as part of the ORN for Wimbledon; A12 East Cross Route as part of the ORN for the Olympic Park; A13 Newham Way as part of the ORN for the Olympic Park. If journeys in these areas are essential then drivers should allow more time for their journey </li>
<li>Cultural events are taking place across London today, see <a href="http://www.molpresents.com">www.molpresents.com</a> for further information. If possible, avoid these areas if you are not attending an event</li></ul>
