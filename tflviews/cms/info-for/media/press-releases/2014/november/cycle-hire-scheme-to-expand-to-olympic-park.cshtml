        Mayor confirms Cycle Hire scheme is set to expand to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">

        <p>Londoners
        and visitors to the capital will be able to explore the beauty of the Queen
        Elizabeth Olympic Park on two wheels more easily after the Mayor and Transport
        for London (TfL) confirmed today that the capital's flagship Cycle Hire scheme
        will be expanding to the Park.
        &nbsp;
        The
        expansion of eight new docking stations with a total of 320 docking points will
        fully integrate Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park into the Cycle Hire area (which
        already covers 100km2 ). </p>
        <p>This would open the 560 acre Park up to
        cyclists of all abilities and deliver a further cycling legacy from the London
        2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. Work on the expansion will begin next year
        and will be completed by early 2016.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        docking stations will be placed at key locations around the Park, including the
        ArcelorMittalOrbit, the London Aquatics Centre and the Lee Valley&nbsp;Velopark,
        providing visitors with a quick, cheap and fun way to explore the Park's many
        features. Three docking stations would also be installed around Hackney Wick
        station, linking the Park's expansion with the existing hire area. Expanding
        the scheme will also make it easier for people to use Cycle Hire bikes to visit
        Waltham Forest, which is currently being transformed for cyclists as one of the
        Mayor's &quot;Mini Hollands&quot;, as well as use a new proposed Quietway from Aldgate to
        Hainault, which is expected to be delivered by 2016.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>TfL is also working with a range of
        land owners across London to identify further docking station locations that
        can be funded through developer contributions. New docking stations are already
        planned near Putney Pier, Vauxhall and Tower Bridge bringing around 100
        additional docking points to the scheme, with more currently being considered
        across central London.
        &nbsp;
        Since the scheme launched in July
        2010, it has grown in size and popularity, expanding to east London in March
        2012 and to southwest London late last year. The news of Cycle Hire coming to
        Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park comes as the latest figures for ridership show
        that more than 35 million hires have been made since the scheme began, with
        more than a million hires a month being made in each of the last four months.
        Earlier this year, the scheme broke its previous record for the number of hires
        in a single day, with almost 50,000 journeys made within 24 hours.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson,
        said: `Bringing our fantastic Cycle Hire scheme to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park
        will be a major milestone in the continued delycrafication of cycling in our
        city. The Park is already a wonderful place to spend time and the addition of a
        fleet of hire bikes will make it an even more enticing place to visit for
        Londoners and visitors to the capital. Whether you're an experienced cyclist or
        a total novice, I can think of no better way to take in all the sights of the
        Park than by hopping aboard one of our sturdy
        two-wheelers.`
        </p>
        <p>Latest
        customer research illustrates that overall satisfaction for casual users is now
        at 85%, with &quot;last trip&quot; satisfaction for members up to its highest
        score of 80%. In addition, a record 83% of current members said
        they would recommend the scheme to their friends and family.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>TfL is now discussing the specific
        locations for the eight proposed docking stations within the park and around
        Hackney Wick with the relevant land owners. Subject to planning permission,
        work to build the sites will begin next year. The
        initial scheme would be funded through the Mayor's &pound;913m Cycling Vision budget
        but TfL and the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC) will look to use elements
        of Section 106 funding raised from future developments to help fund the capital
        cost of these sites and any potential further expansion throughout the area.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        David Goldstone, Chief Executive,
        London Legacy Development Corporation, said: `It's great news that the Cycle
        Hire scheme is coming to the Park. What better way to explore all 560 acres of
        Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park than on two wheels? Londoners and visitors are
        flocking to the area and this will be another new way to explore the Park. We
        welcome cyclists of all ages and abilities to come and enjoy the beautiful
        parklands.`
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Leon Daniels, Managing Director of
        Surface Transport at TfL, said: &quot;Since the Cycle Hire scheme was introduced in
        London in July 2010, we have seen the number of people cycling across the
        capital grow significantly. We regularly get calls from users to expand the
        scheme to new places, and bringing the scheme to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park,
        London's newest and hugely popular recreational space, is a natural fit.
        &nbsp; `We are now working to find the
        best places for docking stations within the Park and are excited about becoming
        part of a lasting Games legacy.` </p>
        <p>
        </p>

        The creation of an easy-to-use cycle hire scheme was a
        key pledge of the Mayor's manifesto. Barclays Cycle Hire has transformed
        the way that people make short trips around central London. <a href="http://www.tfl.gov/cyclehire">www.tfl.gov/cyclehire</a>
        &nbsp;
         
        <p>The scheme costs just &pound;2 for daily access and is free
        for the first 30 minutes. Customers wishing to speak to a Barclays Cycle
        Hire advisor or become a member can now&nbsp;use a new local rate 0343 222
        6666 number.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The second largest cycle hire scheme in Europe, it
        boasts more than 10,000 bikes at over 700 docking stations, making popular
        London destinations like Battersea Park, Fulham, Hammersmith and
        Portobello Market accessible by hire bike.
        &nbsp;
        More than 90 London Underground stations (including the
        entire Circle line) and a number of major rail stations such as Clapham
        Junction, Liverpool Street, Paddington and Putney are now all within a
        short walk of a docking station, enabling more people to make cycling part
        of their daily commute.
        &nbsp;
        In March 2013, the Mayor of London published his
        Cycling Vision for London, which aims to ensure two wheels are at the
        heart of our transport network. </p>
        <p>This vision included plans for
        intensifying the number of docking points within the current zone through
        identification of new sites and expansion of popular docking stations.
        &nbsp;
        In spring 2014, Enfield, Kingston and Waltham Forest
        boroughs were selected for full mini-Holland status, each receiving up to
        &pound;30m for changes. Proposals include redesigns of key town centres, new
        suburban Cycle Superhighways, new cycle routes, Dutch-style roundabouts
        and rail superhubs &#45; <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/mini-hollands">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/mini-hollands</a>
