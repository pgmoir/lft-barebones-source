            <p>The refurbishment works, which will be undertaken by Metronet Rail BCV, will start in October 2005 and are due to be completed in March 2006. </p>
<p>During the next 10 years, every London Underground (LU) station will be refurbished or modernised.</p>
<p>Epping station will remain open while it is being improved, and passengers should not be affected by the works. </p>
<p>However, advantage will be taken of track closures to complete the works.</p>
<p>Refurbishment works include the restoration of heritage features, the replacement of all CCTV cameras, the installation of customer help points, an enhanced public address system, tactile strips on platforms and contrasting handrails for the partially sighted.</p>
<p>All cabling will be concealed and ceilings will be either replaced or decorated.</p>
