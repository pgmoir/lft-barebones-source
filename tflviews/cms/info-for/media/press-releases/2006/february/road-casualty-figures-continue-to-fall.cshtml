            <p>New figures, released by Transport for London (TfL), show another sharp reduction in the number of people killed and seriously injured on London's roads.</p>
<p>The figures compare the first six months of 2005 with the equivalent period in 2004 and casualties on the Capital's roads have continued to decline. </p>
<p>The overall number of casualties is now 10 per cent lower than in the same period last year and, most significantly, the number of serious injuries is down by 34 per cent.<br><br>Despite the encouraging results however, more than 15,500 people were hurt or killed in the period - including 3,015 pedestrians and 1,327 children under 16 years old - meaning work on reducing the casualty figures in London continues apace.</p>
<p>The Mayor has confirmed that London is now working towards a target of a 50 per cent reduction in road casualties by 2010, having already met the 40 per cent national target, some five years early.</p>
<p>Transport for London is committed to continuing to bring the numbers down by funding further major investments in road safety advertising, education and engineering.<br><br>Key findings are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fatalities have fallen by 10 per cent, from 98 to 88 compared with the same period in 2004 
</li><li>Serious injuries have decreased by 34 per cent and slight injuries have fallen by five per cent 
</li><li>Pedestrians accounted for 41 per cent of all fatalities, but overall pedestrian fatalities fell by 18 per cent 
</li><li>Pedal cyclist casualties decreased by six per cent 
</li><li>Child casualties decreased by 14 per cent 
</li><li>The total number of collisions decreased by seven per cent compared with the same period in 2004 
</li><li>The total number of casualties decreased by 10 per cent in inner London and eight per cent in outer London 
</li><li>Men accounted for 62 per cent of casualties and women 38 per cent<br></li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: "One life lost on London's roads is one life too many, but these latest figures show that increased investment in road safety is continuing to successfully to save lives. </p>
<p>"We can't be complacent and Transport for London is working with boroughs to meet even higher targets to improve road safety."</p>
<p>
<h2>Safer roads</h2>
<p>
<p>Chris Lines, Head of the London Road Safety Unit, added: "These are very large and welcome casualty reductions, and show that London is leading the way in reducing the human and economic cost of road collisions. </p>
<p>"There is still a lot to be done and we must continue to work hard to ensure this excellent trend continues."<br><br>Jenny Jones, Mayor's Road Safety Ambassador and Green Party member on London Assembly, said: "There are a lot of men, women and children walking around London today because we have refused to accept that accidents simply happen. </p>
<p>"There are hundreds of parents, friends and relatives in London who haven't had to suffer the tragedy of losing a loved one, or spending their days caring for someone permanently injured in a traffic crash. </p>
<p>"This success is down to increased investment and a willingness to do what works."</p>
            <ul>
<li>Casualty reduction targets - progress towards the year 2010. In March 2000 the Government announced a new national road safety strategy and casualty reduction targets for 2010 in "Tomorrow's roads - safer for everyone". </li>
<li>By the year 2010, the casualty reduction targets to be achieved, compared with the 1994-98 average are: 
<ul>
<li>a 40 per cent reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured </li>
<li>a 50 per cent reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured </li>
<li>a 10 per cent reduction in the slight casualty rate, expressed as the number of people slightly injured per 100 million vehicle kilometres</li></ul></li>
<li>In addition a Road Safety Plan for London was produced by Transport for London in 2001. This plan supports the national targets and recommends further targets for reducing the numbers of pedestrians, pedal cyclists and powered two-wheeler riders who are killed or seriously injured by 40 per cent by 2010 </li>
<li>Following the excellent casualty reductions achieved in London, especially over the last 3 years, The Mayor has announced new lower targets, to be achieved by 2010: 
<ul>
<li>a 50 per cent reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured </li>
<li>a 50 per cent reduction in the number of cyclists and pedestrians killed or seriously injured </li>
<li>a 60 per cent reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured </li>
<li>a 25 per cent reduction in the slight casualty rate, expressed as the number of people slightly injured per 100 million vehicle kilometres</li></ul></li>
