        <p>Strong collaboration between
        London Underground's (LU's) Network Enforcement Department and the British
        Transport Police has resulted in a three year anti-social behaviour order
        (ASBO) against a prolific offender who repeatedly fare evaded and caused
        harassment, alarm and distress to staff at Gants Hill station throughout 2013.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Naimul Hoque, &nbsp;aged 21,
        from Ilford, was sentenced at Snaresbrook Crown Court, on Wednesday 23 April,
        to 11 months jail for affray and assault on a Police Constable and given a
        further one-month jail term for common assault and fare evasion.</p>
        <p> These
        sentences were suspended for 18 months and he was given a six-month curfew
        order - between 8pm and 6am &#45; and ordered to undergo supervised treatment for
        alcohol. He was also given a three-year ASBO, banning him from all London
        Underground stations unless he is in possession of a valid ticket. </p>
        <p>The ASBO
        also bans him from all LU stations when he is under the influence of alcohol.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Hoque was arrested on
        Thursday 5 September 2013, after he entered Gants Hill station and approached a
        Customer Service Adviser at the gate-line, who had his back turned at the time.
        </p>
        <p>Hoque then viciously poked the member of staff inthe back before pushing
        through the ticket gates to go down to the platforms. </p>
        <p>The matter was reported
        to the British Transport Police and Hoque pleaded guilty to common assault and
        fare evasion at Romford Magistrates' Court in December. </p>
        <p>He was later sentenced
        for these offences and for entirely separate offences of affray and assault on
        a police constable, at Snaresbrook Crown Court.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        Hoque caused such a nuisance
        at Gants Hill station during 2013 that LU's enforcement team gathered 91
        separate statements from LU staff witnesses about his behaviour. </p>
        <p>These
        statements were then passed on to the British Transport Police to enable them
        to secure the ASBO.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Aidan Harris, London
        Underground Manager of the Workplace Violence Unit, said:</p>
        <p> &quot;We will not tolerate
        any form of abuse against our staff who have the right to carry out their work
        duties without fear. Hoque was a constant threat to our staff, exposing them to
        over nine-months of abuse. We welcome the result of his sentencing and hope
        this sends out a clear message that we will continue to work closely with our
        policing partners to provide a safe working environment for staff and our
        customers.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>TfL will be re-launching
        their marketing poster campaign on workplace violence and the damage it can
        cause across the transport network this month. This will focus on reducing
        abuse to staff by encouraging customers to think more about some of their
        behaviours.</p>

            They provide reassurance to customers, staff and tenants who are affected by
            anti-social behaviour. The team also enforce TfL's Zip Card behaviour policy,
            work with the British Transport Police in order to obtain anti-social behaviour

            more than 12,000 CCTV cameras on the Tube and CCTV on all London Buses, have
            helped to secure successful convictions against around 90 per cent of offenders
            taken to court for abusing staff on TfL's networks in the last seven years</li>
            <li>In
            another incident Mihai Cretu, 32, from Tottenham, was sentenced on 16 April, at

            included a four-week curfew requirement enforced through electronic tagging,
