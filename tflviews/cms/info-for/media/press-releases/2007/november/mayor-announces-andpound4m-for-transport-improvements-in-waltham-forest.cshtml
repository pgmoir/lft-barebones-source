<p>Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone said: "This new &pound;4m investment in local transport schemes will make the daily journeys of people in Waltham Forest, safer, greener and more accessible, whether they are travelling by public transport, by car, on foot or by bike.</p>
<p>"Thanks to extra investment in local transport schemes, cycling has increased by 83 per cent since 2000 and more than 1,600 school travel plans have been approved which encourage and enable more children and their parents to walk to school."</p>
<h2>Improving local transport</h2>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: "This &pound;4m investment will go towards directly improving transport for people in Waltham Forest. </p>
<p>"Local people feel strongly about transport in their area and this funding will make a real difference to their experience each day.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>"The investment will fund both large and small projects that will improve bus journeys and access to public transport, reduce congestion, improve the environment and promote a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"This funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in the boroughs to make improvements to local transport."</p>

<ul>
<li>&pound;1,475,000 for road safety schemes to reduce collisions </li>
