<ul>
    <li>Plans include segregated cycle lanes over Lambeth Bridge and the removal of roundabouts</li>
    <li>A new public space at Waterloo would reduce dominance of traffic</li>
    <li>Demonstrates Mayor's commitment to the Healthy Streets Approach and tackling junctions with the worst safety records</li>
</ul>
<p>Major proposals to transform Lambeth Bridge and Waterloo and make them safer for all have today been published.</p>
<p>The plans, which are now being consulted on, are designed to improve conditions for walking, cycling and public transport through the intimidating junctions. They come after Waterloo roundabout and Lambeth Bridge northern roundabout were identified as among the 73 junctions in the Capital with the worst safety record for pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists.</p>
<p>The proposed dramatic changes include segregated cycle lanes, cycle-specific traffic lights, wider paths, the removal or transformation of the intimidating junctions and vastly improved public spaces.</p>
<p>The improvements would also open up new areas of London for safer cycling and link into the current and planned cycle network. The proposals for Lambeth Bridge would join onto Cycle Superhighway 8, a number of Quietways and join onto the improvement work currently underway around Westminster Bridge. Waterloo's proposals would link in with the wider cycle network including nearby Quietway 1 and the proposed Quietway 5.</p>
<p>Concerns over safety are frequently cited as one of the key reasons people do not cycle and overhauling these two notorious junctions will help the Mayor reach his aim for all deaths and serious injuries from road collisions to be eliminated from London's streets by 2041. The improvements are also an example of the Mayor's bold Healthy Streets Approach to make London's streets healthier, safer and more welcoming.</p>
<p>Last week, the Mayor announced his intention to increase the proportion of people walking, cycling and taking public transport to 80 per cent of journeys by 2041, as part of his draft Transport Strategy. Sadiq Khan's strategy sets out a long-term ambition to transform the Capital's transport network and deliver a fairer, greener, healthier and more prosperous city for all Londoners.</p>
<p>Will Norman, London's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, said: </p>
<p>'Our plans for Lambeth Bridge and Waterloo will make a real difference to these intimidating junctions. They will be completely transformed to make the areas safer and more pleasant to travel through, and will link cyclists up to our wider cycle network. It's a great example of our work to improve London's most dangerous junctions and create people-friendly streets across the city.'</p>
<p>Leon Daniels, Managing Director of Surface Transport, said: </p>
<p>'The Mayor has set ambitious plans for 80 per cent of all trips in London to be on foot, bike or public transport by 2041 and these ambitious plans for Lambeth Bridge and Waterloo rise to that challenge. By boosting sustainable and active travel we can make the most efficient use of road space to support growth and benefit the environment, health and the economy. We encourage Londoners to let us know what they think about the proposals to help make them as good as possible.'</p>
<p>Cllr Matthew Bennett, Cabinet Member for Planning, Regeneration and Jobs, said: </p>
<p>'As a council we are committed to ensuring this project benefits everyone, that it brings opportunities for local residents, including more jobs and business opportunities, safer streets and a more pleasant environment. We have been working with local residents and TfL over many years to make Waterloo a more attractive place, and to improve everyone's ability to move around. I hope these proposals bring those ambitions closer to fruition and I'd encourage everybody who lives, works and travels through Waterloo to take a look and let us know their thoughts.</p>
<p>'As well as the Waterloo City Hub, we've worked with TfL on Westminster Bridge South roundabout to improve pedestrian and cycle safety and Lambeth Bridge South. We have invested in upgrading Lower Marsh, and are about to do the same on Westminster Bridge Road. Together, we think these will make Waterloo a safer, happier and healthier place.'</p>
<p>The proposals for Lambeth Bridge northern and southern roundabout have been developed through extensive research and engagement to ensure that the work is truly transformative. Both roundabouts would be removed and replaced with safer signalised crossroads. These crossroads would remove a number of conflicts between cyclists and vehicles and provide signalised pedestrian crossings.</p>
<p>The proposals for Lambeth Bridge and the surrounding area would:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create segregated cycle lanes across the bridge</li>
    <li>Create two-stage facilities for cyclists turning right at both crossroads</li>
    <li>Ensure that left-turning cyclists can bypass both crossroads to eliminate conflict</li>
    <li>Introduce cycle signals to allow cyclists to be separated in time or space from general traffic</li>
    <li>Provide signalised pedestrian crossings and increase overall space for pedestrians</li>
</ul>
<p>The proposals for Waterloo would make the most effective use of limited road space, helping to support the ongoing regeneration and growth of Waterloo by encouraging sustainable and active travel. The plans have been developed after close engagement with the local community and stakeholders.</p>
<p>The area around Waterloo is currently overcrowded and unpleasant for pedestrians, cyclists and bus users. This will be exacerbated by the expansion of the railway station and planned developments - making these changes all the more necessary.</p>
<p>TfL and Lambeth Council's proposals for Waterloo would:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a new large public square by closing the south west corner of the roundabout</li>
    <li>Return safer two-way traffic around Waterloo Imax</li>
    <li>Introduce safer segregated cycle lanes around the Imax</li>
    <li>Widen footways and improve a pedestrian crossing</li>
    <li>Improve the bus station on Waterloo Road</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these changes, the proposals would declutter the area, improve pedestrian crossings and increase the greenery in the area.</p>
<p>Cycling would be made easier and more appealing through dedicated space and signals to reduce collisions. The links into the wider cycling network would also be improved. Both pedestrians and bus users would benefit from a new signalised crossing, a new public square and wider footways.</p>
<p>Subject to the results of the public consultations, which close on 20 August, work around Waterloo could begin in late 2019 while Lambeth could begin as soon as next year.</p>

<p>Notes to Editors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Last week, the Mayor used his draft strategy to set out bold plans to reduce the Capital's dependency on the car - transforming the experience of walking, cycling and public transport in London over the coming decades</li>
    <li>The Mayor will set out a target to increase the proportion of people walking, cycling and taking public transport to 80 per cent of journeys by 2041, compared to 64 per cent now, meaning an average of 3 million fewer car journeys in London each day</li>
    <li>A key focus of this is the Mayor's &pound;2.1bn Healthy Streets approach. This aims to create more attractive, accessible and people-friendly streets, where everybody can enjoy spending time and being physically active by making walking and cycling easier and safer across London</li>
    <li>Currently, more than 40 per cent of Londoners do not achieve the recommended 150 minutes of activity a week, and 28 per cent do less than 30 minutes a week. GLA analysis shows that if every Londoner walked or cycled for 20 minutes a day, it would save the NHS &pound;1.7bn in treatment costs over the next 25 years</li>
    <li>Earlier this year, Will Norman named the 73 junctions in the Capital with the worst safety records as he unveiled a new approach to delivering improvements for pedestrians and cyclists. New analysis uses the last three years of casualty figures on the TfL road network to identify the junctions with the poorest safety records so that they can be targeted for work. This analysis will now continue each year as part of a new approach that will see work continually monitored and the junctions with the most incidents prioritised</li>
</ul>
