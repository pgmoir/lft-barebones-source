        The information on this page explains how Transport for London (TfL) uses the personal information you supply when you contact Capital Call or use our services. It also describes how long that information is kept and the circumstances in which we might disclose it to a third party.

      <h2>Personal information we hold</h2>
<p ><br />
Capital Call is closed to new members. The service was originally managed through Hackney Community Transport (HCT) up until 1 July 2018. Transport for London (TfL) took over the management of Capital Call on 2 July 2018. HCT wrote to all Capital Call members in March and June 2018 to gain consent to share their personal information with TfL in order to retain their membership with Capital Call. The personal information we hold includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Name, address, date of birth, telephone number, email address</li>
    <li>Information relating to your disability, health or long-term condition (eg relating to your mobility)</li>
    <li>Information relating to your mobility aids and travel requirements</li>
    <li>Emergency contact details</li>
    <li>Taxicard number (which is used as your Capital Call membership number)</li>
    <li>Communication preferences</li>
    <li>Enquiries, complaints or other correspondence from you</li>
    <li>Records of the journeys you have booked with Capital Call from 2 July 2018</li>
</ul>
<p>If you telephone the Capital Call customer contact centre, your call will be recorded for training and quality purposes.</p>
<h2>Legal basis for using your information</h2>
<p>Under data protection legislation, TfL is only allowed to use personal information if we have a proper reason or 'legal basis' to do so.  In the case of Capital Call, there are a number of these legal grounds we rely on, which are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Our statutory and public functions:
    <ul>
        <li>to undertake activities to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport facilities and services, and to deliver  the Mayor's Transport Strategy</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Where you have given your consent to TfL, for example:
    <ul>
        <li>you have asked the contact centre to resolve an issue or complaint for you</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we also need to collect or store information that is defined as 'special category personal data'. In respect of Capital Call, this consists of health, disability or mobility information we collect from you.</p>
<p>As before, there are a number of legal grounds we rely on when handling this kind of information, depending on the circumstances, which are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Where we have your explicit consent to do so for a particular purpose</li>
    <li>For the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims</li>
    <li>Where it's necessary for equality of opportunity or treatment</li>
</ul>
<h2>Obtaining and using your information</h2>
<p>The personal information we hold was provided by you when you gave your consent to HCT to share this with TfL as part of the transfer process prior to 2 July 2018, and any subsequent customer update forms we might send to you.
TfL and the companies that process personal information on our behalf will use your personal information for the following purposes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>customer services and administration (including assessing and reviewing your eligibility to receive the Capital Call Service)</li>
    <li>the provision of door-to-door travel services</li>
    <li>customer research</li>
    <li>fraud prevention</li>
</ul>
<p>
We may send you information from time to time on issues relating to Capital Call or our other assisted transport and public transport services that TfL or London Councils operate in London such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>information on how to use Capital Call
    </li>
    <li>availability of services at certain times of the year (eg bank holidays)
    </li>
    <li>other important updates or changes to Capital Call
    </li>
    <li>information about improvements to Dial-a-Ride, Taxicard or mainstream bus services</li>
    <li>consultations about TfL's plans for accessible travel in London</li>
</ul>
<h2>Length of time we keep your information
</h2>
<p>The personal information transfer consent form that you completed prior to 2 July 2018 will be stored for one year and then securely destroyed. We will keep an electronic record of your personal information for as long as you're a member of Capital Call.</p>
<p>If you submit any enquiries to Capital Call either by letter, telephone, or email, these will be retained electronically in accordance with TfL's information and records disposal policy.
</p>
<p>After you stop being a member we will keep your information for up to five years. This is for the following reasons:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>To respond to correspondence, concerns or complaints</li>
    <li>To maintain records according to rules that apply to us</li>
    <li>To establish and defend any legal rights
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Keeping personal information secure
</h2>
<p>We take the privacy of our customers very seriously. A range of robust policies, processes and physical and technical measures are all in place to control and safeguard access to, and use of, personal information associated with TfL's management and operation of the Capital Call transport service.</p>
<p>Anyone with access to personal information held in TfL's systems is required to complete TfL's privacy and data protection training on an annual basis.</p>
<p>We also publish guidance on the steps you can take to protect your personal information.
</p>
<h2>Automated processing and profiling</h2>
<p>Under data protection legislation we have to let you know when we use your personal information do something 'automatically' using our computers or other systems, or make an automated decision (without human intervention) that significantly affects you.</p>
<p>In the case of Capital Call, TfL does not make decisions based solely on the use of automated systems, databases or computer applications.
Occasionally TfL may use aggregated or depersonalised Capital Call information to carry out research and analysis, for example, to assess the usage of our service. We may also use it to identify improvements we might need to make to the service (or other assisted travel options in London) in future. Individuals will not be identified using this information.
</p>
<h2>Sharing personal information</h2>
<p>TfL uses external service providers to provide a computerised booking and scheduling system, to undertake customer satisfaction surveys, to distribute in-house information about the Capital Call service and to provide all journeys for the service.
</p>
<p>If you have a query about your membership or use of the Capital Call service, and would like a third party to contact us on your behalf, we will only deal with them with your permission. This is the case even if the person is your carer, partner or spouse; a member of your family; living at the same address as you; or your legal representative.
</p>
<p>We may share your personal information with other public bodies such as your local authority for the purposes of safeguarding. We may also share it with London Councilsfor the purposes of preventing and detecting fraud and the monitoring and planning of assisted transport provision in London. (London Councils operate the Taxicard and Freedom Pass Schemes.) Any such information-sharing will be carried out in accordance with privacy and data protection legislation and with the appropriate written agreements in place.
</p>
<p>In some circumstances, disclosures of personal data to the police (and other law enforcement agencies) are permitted by data protection legislation, if they relate to the prevention or detection of crime and/or the apprehension or prosecution of offenders. Before any such disclosure takes place, the police are required to demonstrate that the personal data concerned will assist them in this respect. Each police request to TfL is dealt with on a strict case-by-case basis to ensure that any such disclosure is lawful and in accordance with the data protection legislation.
</p>
<h2>Overseas processing</h2>
<p>TfL and its service providers may process your personal information in countries within the European Economic Area (EEA). Any such processing will be carried out in strict accordance with UK and EU privacy legislation and the appropriate contractual safeguards which TfL has put in place.</p>
<h2>Your information rights</h2>
<p>Under data protection legislation you are entitled to ask to see any personal information that we hold about you.  Please see our page on how to <a href="/corporate/privacy-and-cookies/access-your-data">access your data</a> for further details.</p>

<p>You also have a number of other information rights which include:</p>
