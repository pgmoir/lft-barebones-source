        West London boroughs set to benefit from the Mayor and TfL's &pound;148m fund for local transport improvements in 2015/16
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Town centres across West London are set to be transformed after the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today confirmed &pound;148m in funding for local transport and public realm projects in 2015/16. Local areas will see safer roads, better public spaces, improved walking facilities and cycling made safer and easier.</p>
<p>The annual funding has been allocated by TfL to each London borough to support the delivery of its Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.</p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of delivering road improvements in support of the Mayor's transport priorities, LIP investment levels of &pound;148m per year have been maintained for next year, despite a reduction in TfL's central Government funding.</p>
<p>LIP funding for 2015/16 will support a range of different transport initiatives across West London produced by the boroughs including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Brent - &pound;160,000 for a project to make roads safer, including a review of junctions and streets with high collision rates, which have been identified by TfL's road safety data, such as Ealing Road South, Kenton Road and Brentfield Road</li>
    <li>Ealing - &pound;500,000 for a project in Sudbury Village which will see significant interchange improvements between the two rail stations in Sudbury</li>
    <li>Hammersmith and Fulham &#45; &pound;350,000 towards designing new 20mph zones and measures to tackle collision hot spots. &pound;150,000 for a new cycle route on the A315 and &pound;130,000 for environmental improvements on Stevenage Road</li>
    <li>Harrow - &pound;100,000 for new 20mph zones including Park High and Welldon Park. &pound;220,000 for projects to improve the reliability of bus services across the borough and &pound;150,000 for new cycle projects, including an extension of the Pinner Road/Park Road cycle route</li>
    <li>Hounslow - &pound;50,000 to improve the accessibility of bus stops and &pound;150,000 for a community programme to promote sustainable travel. &pound;1m to progress improvements to Hounslow Town Centre, which will enhance transport links from the Hounslow East, Central and National Rail stations</li>
    <li>Hillingdon - &pound;1.9m towards the &pound;7m project to improve Hayes Town Centre, which includes reopening Station Road to through traffic and a new roundabout at Station Road/Botwell Lane</li>
    <li>Kensington and Chelsea - &pound;55,000 towards a &pound;1.7m Golborne Road streetscape improvement project, which will create more space for pedestrians and market traders near Portobello Road.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: `This funding is specifically targeted to provide benefits at key locations across London, helping to make the capital's roads and open spaces safer, more pleasant places to be. Providing better cycling and walking routes, as well as a raft of major improvements to our streets will help to boost the quality of life of those who live and work in our great city. By working with the boroughs to deliver better transport in their areas, we can in turn help to support jobs and economic growth in the capital as a whole.'</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, said: `This funding will help continue to deliver real improvements to communities in West London. We are working in partnership with West London boroughs to deliver hundreds of transport projects that will benefit local communities and all road users whether they are pedestrians, cyclists or drivers. Public squares and shopping areas will also be rejuvenated, attracting more people to those areas and boosting the local economy.'</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring the boroughs have the necessary funding to improve the quality of their local roads TfL is also working with them to help improve efficiency, add value for money and keep the disruption of road and construction works to a minimum. For example, London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) help the boroughs avoid individually appointing contractors to undertake works. These are four area-based joint highway contracts, helping to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>TfL is also working in partnership with London Councils to identify any gaps in skills and resources, which could be filled through more collaborative working between boroughs and TfL, such as apprenticeships, mentoring and sharing resources.</p>
<p>Last year West London boroughs used TfL funding for their Local Implementation Plans to deliver a range of improvements to local communities through safer junctions, reduced traffic speeds and better walking routes.</p>
<p>Significant projects in West London awarded funding last year include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hammersmith and Fulham &#45; &pound;2.4m investment for the major project in Shepherd's Bush, which will be completed in June 2015 and includes segregated cycle lanes enhanced streetscape and improved pedestrian facilities</li>
    <li>Hounslow - &pound;40,000 to deliver eight Legible London signs for pedestrians in Hounslow Town Centre, making it easier for people to find their way. &pound;200,000 for a Greenways programme to implement off-road pathways for pedestrians and cyclists, linking parks and open spaces in the borough</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.  While Transport for London allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough.</p>
