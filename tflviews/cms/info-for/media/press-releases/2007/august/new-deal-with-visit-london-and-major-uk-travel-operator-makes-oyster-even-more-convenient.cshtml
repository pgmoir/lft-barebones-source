<p>Transport for London (TfL), Visit London, the capital's official visitor organisation, and UK short break specialist Superbreak have launched a new deal to enable visitors to buy and receive Visitor Oyster Cards before they arrive in the capital giving them quicker, easier journeys and more time to enjoy their trip.</p>
<p>The agreement means that visitors are able to purchase a Visitor Oyster Card via Superbreak's website: <a href="http://www.superbreak.com/">http://www.superbreak.com/</a> or Visit London's at <a href="http://www.visitlondon.com/">http://www.visitlondon.com/</a> and it will be sent out with &pound;10 worth of travel loaded onto the card.<br>&nbsp;<br>London's Oyster card is an electronic smartcard which holds cash and travel cards enabling passengers to pay for Tube, bus, Docklands Light Railway and tram journeys. Launched in 2003 it has been a huge success with more than ten million in circulation and 38 million journeys a week made using Oyster.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is the cheapest way to buy single fares and over several journeys in one day, Oyster will calculate the cheapest fare for your travel simply by touching in and out on the Tube and Docklands Light Railway and touching in on the buses and Croydon Tramlink. </p>
<h2>Benefits</h2>
<p>Giles Bailey, Head of Group Marketing Strategy and Integration for TfL,&nbsp;said: "The&nbsp;cheapest and&nbsp;most convenient&nbsp;way for visitors&nbsp;to travel on public transport in London is with a Visitor&nbsp;Oyster card. </p>
<p>"This agreement with Superbreak will&nbsp;give easier&nbsp;access to Oyster to millions of visitors to&nbsp;the Capital,&nbsp;so they can take advantage of the same benefits enjoyed by Londoners every day.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Visitor Oyster cards&nbsp;can be&nbsp;used for future visits to London or they could be given as a gift or lent to friends and family."</p>
<p>James Bidwell, Visit London Chief Executive, said: "It is important that we provide visitors with the best possible information on how to enjoy London. Oyster cards provide the most cost-effective way of getting around the capital and being able to offer the cards online means that the Visit London website really does provide a one-stop shop for visitors to London. </p>
<h2>Cheaper fares</h2>
<p>"visitlondon.com has recently been redesigned to allow London's visitors to navigate information quicker and easier and book a range of products and services including hotel rooms, theatre tickets and restaurants. Buying an Oyster card online greatly increases the information and assistance we provide visitors." </p>
<p>Ray Jones, Marketing Director at Superbreak, comments: "This is the first time any prospective visitor to London has been able to buy their Visitor Oyster card from a leading travel operator before they arrive in the Capital.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Always cheaper than paying the cash fare, your Visitor Oyster Card will also automatically calculate the cheapest fare for a day's worth of trips, so you don't have to. The card can be bought either on its own or as part of a short break package, making it even easier to visit London."<br>&nbsp;<br>Visit London, the Capital's tourist information body, has also added a function to its website to allow visitors to purchase the Visitor Oyster Cards from Superbreak.&nbsp;<br>
