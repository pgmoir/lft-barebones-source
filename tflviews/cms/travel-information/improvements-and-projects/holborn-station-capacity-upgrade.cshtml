    <p>At the busiest times, large numbers of customers are trying to get into and out of the station, as well as changing between the Central and Piccadilly lines. Everyone who uses the station currently has to pass through a single point at the bottom of the main escalators.</p>

<p>During the evening peak, we often have to hold people outside the ticket gates, sometimes for as long as 20 minutes. Demand is set to increase and if we do nothing, these issues will become worse.</p>

<p>Around 40% of trips from Holborn station in the evening peak are to local stations just a short walk away:</p>

<h2>Funding</h2>

<p>We are still committed to&nbsp;improving Holborn station, including making the station step-free. But continued lack of certainty around future capital investment from Government means some projects and priorities have had to be adapted.</p>

<p>We will continue to try&nbsp;to identify third party funding to help with the scheme. The upgrade of Holborn station would support the wider upgrade of the Piccadilly line and we&nbsp;are still making the case to Government for long-term, sustained investment in public transport across London.</p>
</div>
 <div>

<h2>Our proposals</h2>

<p>We believe our customers would benefit from:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A new second entrance and exit to the station</li>
	<li>More escalators</li>
	<li>Step-free access</li>
	<li>More space to change between trains</li>
</ul>

<p>These improvements would help to stimulate the local economy and generate growth in the Holborn area. A consultation on&nbsp;<a href="https://consultations.wearecamden.org/culture-environment/copy-of-copy-of-kentish-town-planning-framework/">Camden Council's Vision and Urban Strategy for Holborn</a>&nbsp;ran until 3 July 2019.</p>

<p>A possible site for a new station entrance would be at the southern end of Procter Street.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Escalators from there could provide a direct route to the Central line platforms</li>
	<li>There would be a new second route via escalators to the Piccadilly line platforms</li>
	<li>We would install lifts at the Kingsway entrance to provide step-free access from street to trains</li>
	<li>We would improve the layout of the Kingsway entrance</li>
</ul>

<p>This plan would reduce congestion below ground and relieve pressure on the existing Kingsway entrance. Below ground there would be more space, including a new concourse at the Piccadilly line level.</p>

<p>These changes would support future plans to increase the number of trains on the Central and Piccadilly lines.</p>

<h2>Local partner</h2>

<p>We're working&nbsp;with <a href="http://bee-midtown.org/">Bee Midtown</a>&nbsp;(the local Business Improvement District) to&nbsp;look at funding opportunities and how to reduce the cost.</p>

<h2>Public consultation</h2>

<p>More consultation is needed&nbsp;on how the proposed new station entrance will be built and how we will manage the impact of construction.</p>

<p>After that consultation, we&nbsp;would apply to the Secretary of State for Transport for a Transport and Works Act Order (TWAO) - permission to do the work. It's likely there will then be a public inquiry,</p>

<p>We held a first public consultation on our proposals in 2017. Our reports on the consultation are on the <a href="https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/tube/holborn-station-upgrade/?intcmp=50013">Holborn station capacity improvements consultation page</a>.</p>
