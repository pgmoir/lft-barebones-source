 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The award which bears an inscription of the year of Mr Collin's birth in 1915 was presented to him and his family at a specially organised ceremony at the Public Carriage Office.</p>
<p>As London's longest serving taxi driver Mr Collins drove his first passenger in 1937 and his last passenger just a few years ago.</p>
<p>Some of his most famous passengers have included Margaret Thatcher, Joan Collins and Bruce Forsyth.</p>
<p>On presentation of the award, David Brown, Managing Director, Surface Transport, said: "I would like to thank Mr Collins for 70 years of sterling service to the travelling public of London.</p>
<p>"We are proud of the invaluable contribution he has made to the Capital, and to Londoners and visitors alike who value the black taxi as an iconic landmark."</p>
<p>Mr Collins said: "It has been a great privilege to serve the people of London.</p>
<p>"It really does not seem that nearly 70 years has passed by.</p>
<p>"I have had the pleasure of meeting people from all walks of life, politicians, celebrities and the great British public.</p>
<p>"Life is all about communication and I have enjoyed sharing my vast experience of life as well as learning a lot with some of my passengers.</p>
<p>"I will treasure these memories for the rest of my life. I would also like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my late wife who supported me all those years and more."</p>
<p>At 92, Mr Collins is in remarkably good shape, he enjoys current affairs, computing, and says the secret to a long life is not to worry and always take a little exercise.</p>
