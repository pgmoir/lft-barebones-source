 <div class="on-this-page">
<ul>
    <li>Extra bus and river services running to help people get around, and all public transport and roads are expected to be much busier than usual, especially during peak hours</li>
    <li>Additional Santander Cycles hubs are in place at key central London locations to make cycling an easy option</li>
    <li>Customers are advised to travel outside the peak if possible, check before they travel at www.tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike and by following &#64;TfLTravelAlerts, &#64;TfLTrafficNews and &#64;TfLBusAlerts on Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>London Underground (LU) is reminding customers that no Tube services are running today as a result of strike action by the ASLEF, RMT, Unite and TSSA unions. There may also be some disruption to services tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Staff on the bus network, the DLR, London Overground, TfL Rail, Trams, river services, Emirates Air Line and Santander Cycles are not on strike, and extra bus and river services are available to help people get around.</p>
<p>LU has tried everything possible to engage the unions over the last five months to try to reach an agreement on pay and the introduction of the Night Tube 24-hour Underground services at weekends from September. The process has been hampered by the unions frequently walking out of negotiations or refusing to turn up. LU received no response to the fair and competitive pay offer made last Monday.</p>
<p>LU has also made clear that in running services overnight:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No one is being asked to work more hours;</li>
    <li>Most staff will not be affected at all by the Night Tube;</li>
    <li>For the majority of those who are affected, the night service will mean a few extra nights per year within existing contracts;</li>
    <li>A realistic and substantial pay rise is being offered this year and for the next 2 years, with additional payment for overnight working, on top of an already fair pay package.</li>
</ul>
<p>Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: </p>
<p>'A night time Tube service is something Londoners and businesses have been requesting for many years. It will make life easier for everyone, cut journey times, create jobs and boost the economy.  We want to reward our staff for its delivery and have been open and transparent in our negotiations with the trade unions &#45; but unfortunately they have failed to engage. We have put forward a very, very fair offer, which consists of an average salary increase of 2 per cent, 1 per cent or RPI (whichever is greater) for next year and the one after, plus a &pound;500 night tube launch bonus and an additional &pound;2000 bonus for night tube train drivers. No one will have to work more hours than they do now, and we have a longer term plan, which will mean no one will need to work nights if they don't want to. Given these commitments, the key question Londoners will rightly be asking, is why the unions have refused to put this new pay deal to their memberships and instead opted to push on with completely unnecessary strike action, which is inflicting major disruption on Londoners and businesses today.'</p>
<p>Latest Travel advice to customers (07:00):</p>

    <li>It is widely supported by Londoners and businesses and will transform night time journeys across London.</li>
    <li>Journey times will be cut by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour.</li>
    <li>London's night-time economy will be opened up to a host of new opportunities, with the Night Tube supporting around 2,000 permanent jobs and boosting the economy by &pound;360 million.</li>
