<p>"We are pleased the RMT has suspended its strike action at Metronet, following the clarification of all jobs and pensions issues.</p>
<p>"We will now work to provide the best possible Tube service on Wednesday. However, as the strike was suspended so late this evening, it will take time for us to restore a full service on all Underground lines tomorrow.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"Passengers should check before they travel to see how Tube services are running. Our staff will be available to provide travel advice and assistance on Wednesday."</p>
