        More than 35 per cent of services operating across 9 of the 11 lines
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Nearly 75 per cent of London Underground (LU) stations are open this evening, with services operating on 9 out of 11 lines, despite the completely unnecessary strike action called by the leaderships of the RMT and TSSA unions.  </p>
<p>Some train services got up and running before 05:30 today, and 91 per cent of regular oyster customers have been travelling in London this morning. </p>
<p>More trains are running to more destinations and more stations are open than yesterday and this, along with a range of other transport options, is keeping London moving and open for business. </p>
<p>Yesterday LU ran over a third of services, with 70 per cent of stations open. Some 86 per cent of regular Oyster customers travelled in London and Barclays Cycle Hire journeys were up by 50 per cent, as they are today. LU intends to resume normal services across the network from first thing on Friday morning.</p>
<p>Mike Brown MVO, London Underground's Managing Director, said today:</p>
<p>`Many thousands of LU and TfL staff are working hard again today to keep customers informed and to keep London moving and open for business.  </p>
<p>`I am grateful to our customers for their patience, and we will be doing everything we can to run as many services as possible. </p>
<p>`I'm pleased that more staff have come to work today than yesterday and that we've been able to get nearly 75 per cent of stations open.</p>
<p>`Our plans will see all Tube stations will remain staffed and controlled at all times when services are operating, and we'll be introducing a 24-hour service at weekends during 2015. </p>
<p>`In future, there will be more staff in ticket halls and on platforms to help customers buy the right ticket, plan their journeys and to keep them safe and secure.</p>
<p>`We're committed to implement these changes without compulsory redundancies and there'll be a job for everyone at LU who wants to work for us and be flexible.'</p>
<p>The strikes have been called by the leadership of the RMT and TSSA unions over LU's plans to modernise and improve customer service.  LU Managing Director, Mike Brown has made the following commitments to Londoners:</p>
<ul>
    <li>All stations will remain staffed and controlled at all times, with more staff visible to help customers </li>
    <li>We'll introduce a new 24-hour service at weekends from 2015 </li>
    <li>We'll provide more frequent and reliable services with better, more accessible stations </li>
    <li>We'll introduce simpler ticketing - such as contactless bank card payment </li>
    <li>We'll provide the best possible value for the fare you pay</li>
</ul>
<p>Latest Travel advice to customers (17:30):<br />The situation may change throughout the day and buses and the transport network will be very busy. </p>
<p>TfL is urging all customers to plan ahead and to check before they travel at tfl.gov.uk and by following &#64;TfLTravelAlerts, &#64;TfLTrafficNews and &#64;TfLBusAlerts on Twitter. </p>
<p>LU is working to keep services operating until at least 23:00hrs, but customers are advised to complete their homeward journeys as soon as possible.<br /> <br />London Underground<br />Services are currently operating as follows:<br />Please check for the latest updates before you travel.</p>
