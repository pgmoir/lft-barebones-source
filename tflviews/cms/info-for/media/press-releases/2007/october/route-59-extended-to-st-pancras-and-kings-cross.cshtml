<p>The extension will create a direct bus link between Waterloo, St Pancras and King's Cross. </p>
<p>Eurostar passengers will be amongst those who benefit, when the Eurostar terminal moves to St. Pancras International on 14 November.</p>
<p>The route will continue to serve Euston Bus Station and then run along Euston Road, with stops at St. Pancras and King's Cross. </p>
<p>John Barry, Head of Network Development for London Buses, said: "The extension of route 59 will give a direct journey option between Waterloo, St. Pancras and King's Cross. </p>
<p>"It also creates new bus links for Brixton and Kennington."</p>
<p>The change comes following a review of the existing service and reflects requests received from a number of passenger groups, including London TravelWatch. </p>
<p>Brian Cooke, Chairman of London TravelWatch, said: "We are delighted that passengers will now benefit from a much-needed direct link between Waterloo and King's Cross St. Pancras stations."</p>
