            <p>Mayor of London Ken Livingstone said: "London is the only major city in the world to achieve a shift away from cars to public transport, cycling and walking. </p>
<p>"As well as providing a reliable service to encourage Londoners out of their cars, Transport for London is making real progress in reducing transport's impact on the environment."</p>
<p>Barry Broe, Director of Transport Planning and Policy, said:"TfL is making great progress towards providing a safe, reliable and clean transport service for London, as well as one that is as energy efficient as possible.</p>
<p>"We are pleased with the achievements made this year. </p>
<p>"This report demonstrates TfL's commitment to environmental improvement and energy efficiency while delivering a world class transport system for a world class city. </p>
<p>"There is still more to be done but this shows great progress so far."</p>
<p>In the period from 2004/05, TfL made significant progress on seven out of its ten objectives, which are based on the Mayor's five environmental strategies including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced measured air emissions of fine particles by 28 per cent since 2003/04. This is primarily due to the completion of fitting of particulate traps on all buses 
</li><li>The percentage of renewable energy purchased by London Underground is up 3.7 per cent to 17.9 per cent for 2003/04. LU's station energy consumption in 2005 was reduced by 24 per cent across all stations exceeding the target of 20  per cent against a baseline year.
</li><li>Large amounts of waste are recycled; 87 per cent of construction and demolition waste, and 20 per cent of commercial and industrial waste (up from 12 per cent in 2003/04)
</li><li>TfL continues to invest in applications of sustainable technologies such as solar power for bus and taxi stops and shelters
</li><li>Three zero emission hydrogen fuel cell buses were trialled in a bid to find cleaner fuel for future buses and reduce pollution in the capital
</li><li>The new TfL Freight Unit will promote the sustainable transport of waste and produce the London Freight Plan by the end of 2006</li></ul>
            <ul>
<li>TfL is investing &pound;10bn over the next five years to improve and expand London's transport network </li>
