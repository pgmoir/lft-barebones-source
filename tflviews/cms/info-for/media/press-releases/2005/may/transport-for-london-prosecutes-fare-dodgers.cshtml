        Transport for London (TfL) has successfully prosecuted 41 people, at Brent Magistrates court, following their failure to pay penalty fares.

                            Fare evasion on bus, trams and buses amounts to approximately &pound;60m a year

            <p>The fare dodgers were issued with penalty fare notices on bus routes around London, but had subsequently failed to pay. </p>
<p>They were sent reminder notices and when these were ignored TfL withdrew the penalty fares and issued summonses against the individuals. </p>
<p>Jeff Tucker, Head of Bus Enforcement, said: "This is a major change in the handling of unpaid penalty fares and one which will be actively pursued to ensure effective action against fare evaders. </p>
<p>"The failure to pay the penalty fare has resulted in each person on average being fined &pound;100 plus &pound;95 costs, and having a criminal record.</p>
<p>"Fare evasion on bus, trams and buses amounts to approximately &pound;60m a year, which would be better put into improving the transport network and assisting the vast majority of our law abiding customers".</p>
<p>In total, &pound;3,995 was awarded to TfL in costs, the court issued fines on top of this figure to the sum of &pound;4,000, making a total of &pound;7,995. </p>
<p>Had each individual paid their penalty fare notice the total would have been only &pound;410. </p>
<p>Had they paid their fares it would have totalled less than &pound;50.</p>
            <ul>
<li>Tfl has over 240 Revenue Protection Inspectors on the bus and tram network, this will rise to 290 later this year </li>
<li>The penalty for travelling without a valid ticket on the Tube, Bus and DLR will rise from &pound;10 to &pound;20 on 12 June 2005.</li></ul>
