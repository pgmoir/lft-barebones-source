        The 111 bus route, which runs between Cromwell Road in Kingston and Heathrow Airport, will run 24 hours a day from Saturday 1 December.

<p>The route will provide a half hourly service throughout the night, seven days a week. </p>
<p>It will improve night time links from Kingston to Hampton, Feltham, Hounslow and Heathrow Airport. </p>
<p>John Barry, Head of Network Development for London Buses, said: "The new 24 hour service on route 111 is another accessible transport connection for late-night travellers in the Capital.</p>
<p>"London's night bus network has expanded dramatically in recent years with passenger numbers more than doubling since 2000. </p>
<p>"Almost half the users are people travelling to or from work."</p>
<p>The change comes following a review of the existing service.</p>
<p>Kingston Council and the Kingston Town Centre Manager have also requested a 24 hour service on the route. </p>
<p>The change is in line with the Kingston Crime and Disorder Strategy which aims to help people get home quickly and safely at night.</p>
