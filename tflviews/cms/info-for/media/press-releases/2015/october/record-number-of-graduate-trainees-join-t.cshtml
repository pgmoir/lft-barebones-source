<ul>
    <li>15,500 applications for 168 roles across 29 schemes</li>
    <li>Recruitment for 2016 intake now open</li>
</ul>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) has opened its doors to a record number of new graduate trainees, as it continues to ensure the next generation of transport professionals are equipped with the right skills to support London's continued success and economic growth.</p>
<p>The new intake of 168 graduates and 'Year in Industry' students are working across 19 graduate schemes, ranging from Quantity Surveying, Engineering, Software Development, Information Management, Finance and Transport Planning.  The Year in Industry students are on a 12-month placement, which is ideal for sandwich course students who then return to their final year of studies.</p>
<p>Since 2010, TfL has created 571 new graduate roles with the vast majority going on to a permanent job within TfL. Crossrail and its supply chain have also created 428 graduate roles over the last five years, giving the new transport professionals the opportunity to work on Europe's largest construction project that will transform rail travel in London and the South East. Crossrail offers graduates the opportunity to work alongside world class project management teams, contractors and designers delivering the Crossrail project.</p>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson MP, said: </p>
<p>'TfL offers a fantastic inroad for graduates to get their careers off to a flying start. From Crossrail and upgrades on the Tube, to our cycling programme and major new projects on the roads, TfL graduates are not only learning valuable new skills, they are contributing to the evolution and improvement of transport in the Capital.'</p>
<p>The new graduates will work on major transport projects such as the &pound;4 billion roads modernisation programme, the Victoria Tube station modernisation and Crossrail 2.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown MVO, said: </p>
<p>'London's transport network already supports over 30 million journeys a day. As the city's population continues to grow rapidly we're modernising and expanding our services, supporting new jobs, homes and growth. To do this we need a team of dedicated and highly qualified staff with the right skills and experience, and our graduates are central to this work.  They will play a crucial role in helping to build, modernise and maintain our transport network now and in the future.'</p>
<p>Of the new graduates who joined TfL in September 2015, 33 per cent are women, up from 30 per cent in 2014.  2015 marks 100 years of women working in transport, with women taking on operational roles in the First World War and being involved in building landmarks such as Waterloo Bridge, dubbed the 'Ladies Bridge', which opened in December 1945. Through the next round of recruitment, TfL will continue to encourage more women to consider a future in the transport industry.</p>
<p>Danielle Eddington, a second year graduate trainee, said: </p>
<p>'I have just completed my first year on the graduate scheme and I have already been involved in so many interesting projects, including the opening of Tottenham Court Road's new ticket hall, the improvements that have been introduced on the Victoria line and the &pound;4 billion Road Modernisation Plan.</p>
<p>'As part of the scheme, I get the opportunity to work in various departments, which helps me to understand the business from different perspectives and has given me the opportunity to get stuck into a number of diverse projects. TfL's graduate scheme is brilliant because you get to see the effect that your work has on helping millions of people travelling through London every day. Anyone who is up for a challenge and wants to positively change London should definitely apply.'</p>
<p>Since 2007, TfL has consistently appeared on The Times Top 100 list for the best companies to work for as voted for by graduates. This year a record number of 15,500 graduates applied to join TfL's graduate schemes, compared to 11,000 the year before.</p>
