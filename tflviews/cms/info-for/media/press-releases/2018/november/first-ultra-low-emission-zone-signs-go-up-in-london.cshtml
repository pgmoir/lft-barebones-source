<p>TfL has begun installing more than 300 Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) warning signs across central London.</p>

<p>The signs, which are being installed at the same locations as existing Congestion Charge signs, warn drivers at all entry points to the zone, and on a number of key approach routes,&nbsp;to ensure their vehicle meets the tough new emission standards that come in to effect next year.</p>

<p>TfL has been running an extensive communications campaign since the spring to prepare drivers for the ULEZ. TfL has sent more than 2.5 million emails and contacted registered Congestion Charge users whose vehicles do not meet the ULEZ standards, to remind them the new zone&nbsp;begins on 8 April 2019.</p>

<p>TfL is also contacting other drivers it identifies in central London whose vehicles are not currently ULEZ-compliant. This has helped encourage 1.3 million visits to TfL's online compliance checker, where people can check if their vehicle complies with the ULEZ emission standards.</p>

<p>The Ultra Low Emission Zone will help take the most polluted vehicles off London's streets. It is a central part of the Mayor's far-reaching work to make London a healthier, greener place by tackling the severe health impacts caused by London's polluted air.</p>

<p>TfL is committed to ensuring that London's transport is leading the way in ultra low emission vehicles. All new electric taxis are required to be zero-emission capable.</p>

<p>The entire central London bus fleet will be upgraded to meet the ULEZ standard by April 2019, and all buses in London will meet this standard by 2020. Ultimately, all buses will be zero-emission by 2037.</p>

<h2>Leading the way</h2>

<p>To discourage the use of the most polluting vehicles, drivers travelling within the zone and using non-compliant vehicles, will need to pay a daily ULEZ charge of &pound;12.50, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>motorbikes that do not meet Euro 3 standards (roughly the equivalent of not being more than 12 years old in 2019)</li>
	<li>petrol cars and vans that do not meet Euro 4 standards (roughly the equivalent of not being more than 13 years old in 2019)</li>
	<li>diesel cars and vans that do not meet Euro 6 standards (roughly the equivalent of not being more than four years old in 2019)</li>
	<li>Buses, coaches and lorries will need to meet or exceed the Euro VI standard or pay &pound;100 a day</li>
</ul>

<p>Nick Fairholme, Director of Project and Programme Delivery at TfL, said: 'We are committed to tackling the public health crisis that is London's toxic air. It affects all Londoners, causing 9000 premature deaths every year and reducing the quality of life for thousands more.</p>

<p>'We're working hard to prepare Londoners for the ULEZ and to encourage them to opt for vehicles that emit fewer pollutants or walk, cycle or use public transport. We know that many people are aware, with more than 1.3 million checks of vehicles' compliance on our website.</p>

<p>'These new signs will be a physical reminder that the ULEZ is coming, but we won't stop there. We've contacted registered Congestion Charge users and are currently contacting other vehicle owners who drive in central London.'</p>

<p>Sonia Farrey, Director of Advocacy at Unicef UK, said: 'Children are one of the most at risk groups from air pollution, which can leave them with lasting health problems including stunted lung growth, asthma and potentially damage brain development.</p>

<p>'Given this risk, we welcome the introduction of the Ultra-Low Emission Zone that can protect children from this threat to their health and ensure children's right to live in a clean and safe environment.'</p>

<h2>Clean and safe</h2>

<p>Dr Penny Woods, Chief Executive of the British Lung Foundation said: 'We welcome the ULEZ as it goes further than ever before to clean up the capital's filthy air.</p>

<p>'Air pollution is a danger to everyone's health and people living with a lung condition, the elderly and children are most at risk. It's vital that we all work together to address this public health crisis.'</p>

<p>Martijn de Lange, CEO of Hermes UK, said: 'We're proud of our strides forward in sustainability as we become the first parcel carrier to invest in bio fuels for our fleet.</p>

<p>'This, plus the additional investment in our electric vehicles, will not only support our clients in achieving their sustainability goals, but also ultimately benefit people across the UK as we all look to reduce our carbon footprint.</p>

<p>'As a parcel carrier delivering within central London, we are committed to helping improve air quality in the capital and have already upgraded our fleet in advance of the ULEZ to tackle this important health issue.'</p>

<p>Detailed information around how drivers can comply with the new standards can be found on TfL's website.</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors</strong></p>

<p>TfL's extensive marketing campaign covers multiple channels including:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Speaking to 5,000 businesses to discuss and support vehicle upgrade plans.</li>
	<li>More than 2.5 million emails to registered customers</li>
	<li>Posters and digital displays across the whole TfL network</li>
	<li>Social media</li>
	<li>Adverts in print, radio and video-on-demand</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, TfL is working with the DVLA to target owners of non-compliant vehicles we have seen in the zone and provided detailed information on the TfL website, which can be found here: <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone">https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/ultra-low-emission-zone</a></p>
