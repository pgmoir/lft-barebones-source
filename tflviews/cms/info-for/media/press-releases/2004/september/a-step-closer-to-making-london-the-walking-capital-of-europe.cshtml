<p>Walkers will be able to choose any one of six walks to the launch ceremony, ranging from 1 to 17 miles in length, which will be led by the Rambler's Association and the Long Distance Walkers Association. </p>
<p>The Capital Ring is part of the London Strategic Walks Network, funded by Transport for London. The southern section passes through Greenwich, Lewisham, Bromley, Croydon, Lambeth, Wandsworth, Merton, Kingston and Richmond.</p>
<p>Peter Hendy, Managing Director of Surface Transport at Transport for London, said, </p>
<p>"Walking in the Capital is good for the health of Londoners and London. TfL is committed to making London more attractive to walkers, be it in the busy streets of the city, or in London's many, and oft-forgotten, green and open spaces. The completion of the southern section of the Capital Ring walk is another step in the right direction, and takes us further down the path to our ultimate aim of making London the walking capital of Europe."</p>
<h3>Notes to editors:</h3>
<p>In attendance will be the Mayor of Bromley, Councillor Anne Manning, the Mayor of Lewisham, Councillor Steve Bullock, and Jenny Jones, chair of the Walking Advisory Panel of the Greater London Authority. The ceremony will take place at 4pm, beside the information centre inside the Penge entrance.</p>
<p>The six walks leading to the launch ceremony are: 
<ul>
<li>Walk 1 (1 mile) from Crystal Palace Station at 3.30 pm. 
</li><li>Walk 2 (5 miles) from Ravensbourne Station at 1.45 pm. 
</li><li>Walk 3 (9 miles) from Mottingham Station at 12 noon 
</li><li>Walk 4 (11 miles) from Wimbledon Park Station at 11.00 am. 
</li><li>Walk 5 (17 miles) from Woolwich Arsenal Station at 9.00 am.

<p>Further information about this event and the six walks in the network can be found on the Walking Pages of their website, www.tfl.gov.uk/walking, or call the Strategic Walks Information Service on 0870 240 6094 (national rate) or email <a href="mailto:walking&#64;tfl.gov.uk" lid="walking&#64;tfl.gov.uk">walking&#64;tfl.gov.uk</a>.</p>
<p>The southern section of the Capital Ring runs for 34 miles from Woolwich Foot Tunnel to Richmond Bridge. It passes through some of the finest scenery in London such as Oxleas Wood, Wimbledon Common and Richmond Park. The 44-mile northern section back to Woolwich via Highgate Wood, and therefore the whole route, is expected to be launched in Spring 2005.</p>
<p>The Capital Ring has been developed from a proposal by the London Walking Forum. Funding and assistance for completion of the Capital Ring has been provided by Transport for London and the boroughs that the route passes through. The southern section passes through Greenwich, Lewisham, Bromley, Croydon, Lambeth, Wandsworth, Merton, Kingston and Richmond.</p>
<p>The Mayor of Bromley, Councillor Anne Manning, and the Mayor of Lewisham, Councillor Steve Bullock, are expected to join Walk 2 from Ravensbourne Station. Jenny Jones is expected to join Walk 1 from Crystal Palace Station. The Mayor of Merton, Councillor Margaret Brierly, will send the walkers off from Durnsford Road Recreation Ground near Wimbledon Station.</p>
<p>The London Strategic Walks Network is part of an initiative by the Mayor of London to make London "the walking capital of Europe" by 2015. It consists of six routes: Capital Ring, Green Chain Walk, Jubilee Walkway, Lea Valley Walk, London Loop and Thames Path.</p>
