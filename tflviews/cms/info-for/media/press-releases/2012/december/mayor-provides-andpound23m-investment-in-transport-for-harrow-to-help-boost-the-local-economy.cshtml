        The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced &pound;2.3m for Harrow to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Transport for London (TfL)&nbsp;has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.</p>
<p>The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>The &pound;2.3m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Harrow including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;100,000 for a Legible London (way finding signage) project in Harrow Town Centre and Wealdstone to make it easier for pedestrians to find their way around the area.&nbsp;This will be the first Legible London scheme in Harrow </li>
<li>&pound;100,000 to implement signage for dedicated freight routes in the borough, improved enforcement by CCTV and signage for restricted freight routes in the borough as well as production of material for freight operators </li>
<li>&pound;455,000 for bus stop accessibility and route improvements.&nbsp;Changes will include increasing capacity for all buses on Kenton Road bus stops and at Harrow on the Hill bus garage as well as completing bus priority works south of Harrow, from Eastcote Lane and Stanmore to Common Rd/High Rd junction</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:&nbsp; 'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Harrow.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'</p>
<h4>Local invesment </h4>
<p>This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.</p>
<p>Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Harrow and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>Last year in Harrow, it financed cycle training for 610 children and 266 adults, 94 cycle parking spaces, 62 new workplace travel plans, 46 accessible bus stops, 43 new street trees and cycling clubs in three high schools.</p>
<p>Notable larger projects to be undertaken include a scheme at the Stanmore Common Road/High Road Junction which received &pound;150,000 to widen the carriageway to two lanes to minimise traffic queuing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is currently being designed and will be constructed and completed by mid 2013.</p>
