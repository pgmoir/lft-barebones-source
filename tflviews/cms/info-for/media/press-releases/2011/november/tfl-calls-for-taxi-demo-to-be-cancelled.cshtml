        Demo has potential to cause real disruption to the general public and taxi passengers. Demo coincides with two other significant protests.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Transport for London is calling for the United Cabbies Group (UCG) to cancel its planned demonstration today.</p>
<p>The group's justification for the protest is based on inaccurate and false claims about London Taxi and Private Hire and the work it undertakes to provide a safe service for the public.</p>
<p>The protest is scheduled to take place at Trafalgar Square between 16:00 and 20:00 today (Wednesday 9 November).</p>
<p>Members of the RMT's taxi branch are expected to join the demo.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The demonstration is not supported by any of the major taxi trade organisations.</p>
<p>There are concerns that the demonstration could cause significant disruption to transport services in Trafalgar Square and in surrounding roads.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The protest also takes place on the same day that students and electricians will be staging significant protests in the Capital.</p>
<p>John Mason, Director of London Taxi and Private Hire, said: 'It is deeply regretful that a small and isolated group, who do not represent the views of taxi drivers across London, feel the need to stage this demonstration.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'In staging this protest these taxi drivers will be wilfully disrupting the travelling public, the very people they are supposed to serve.'</p>
