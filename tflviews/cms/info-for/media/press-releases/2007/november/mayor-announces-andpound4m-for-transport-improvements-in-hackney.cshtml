<p>The &pound;4m funding will mean &pound;867,000 for more cycle lanes and better facilities for cyclists in Hackney as part of the London Cycle Network+, &pound;806,000 for school travel plans, &pound;198,000 to resurface part of the A107 Lower Clapton Road and &pound;70,000 improve the environment for pedestrians around Lubavitch Girls School, Stamford Hill including pedestrian islands or widened pavements.</p>

<p>Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone said:<br>"This new &pound;4m investment in local transport schemes will make the daily journeys of people in Hackney, safer, greener and more accessible, whether they are travelling by public transport, by car, on foot or by bike.</p>
<p>"Thanks to extra investment in local transport schemes, cycling has increased by 83 per cent since 2000 and more than 1600 school travel plans have been approved which encourage and enable more children and their parents to walk to school."&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Improving local transport</h2>

Local people feel strongly about transport in their area and this funding will make a real difference to their experience each day.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>"The investment will fund both large and small projects that will improve bus journeys and access to public transport, reduce congestion, improve the environment and promote a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp; This funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in the boroughs to make improvements to local transport."</p>

<ul>
<li>&pound;867,000 for the London Cycle Network + </li>
