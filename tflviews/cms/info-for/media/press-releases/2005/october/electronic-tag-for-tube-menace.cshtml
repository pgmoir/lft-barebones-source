            <p>Richard Carroll, 24, unemployed of Crescent Road, Plaistow, was found guilty at Horseferry Road Magistrates court on 18 October of racially aggravated common assault on a station supervisor at Stepney Green station.</p>
<p>Carroll had pleaded guilty to causing &pound;300 of damage to a station door on 2 July 2005. </p>
<p>He also admitted that he spat at a member of staff but denied being racially abusive. However the magistrates deemed that he had been. </p>
<p>A TfL spokesperson said: "Violence and abuse towards TfL staff and customers will not be tolerated and, where possible, we will prosecute. </p>
<p>"Staff and customers have the right to work in a safe and secure environment."</p>
<p>Not only will Carroll be tagged for six months but he will be under a curfew which requires him to stay indoors between 1900 and 0600.  </p>
<p>He was also ordered to pay &pound;50 prosecution costs and &pound;300 compensation to London Underground.<br></p>
