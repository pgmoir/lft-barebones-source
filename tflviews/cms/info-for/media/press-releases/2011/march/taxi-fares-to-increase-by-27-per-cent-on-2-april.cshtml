<p>Taxi passengers are reminded that fares will increase on Friday 2 April.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The below-inflation increase, of 2.7 per cent, was approved by the Transport for London (TfL) Board in February.</p>
<p>The fare increase aims to provide a balance between maintaining income for drivers, who face disproportionately high work-related costs compared to other Londoners, while ensuring passengers still get a fair price for the high quality and unique service provided by the Capital's taxi drivers.</p>
<p>Taxi fares are reviewed annually and calculated by TfL based on a cost index that has been used since 1981.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The process included consultation by TfL with the taxi trade and others, including London TravelWatch and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry. </p>
<p>The 2.7 per cent fare increase for the next financial year takes into account a number of factors including a 12 per cent increase in fuel costs and a two per cent increase in average national earnings. </p>
