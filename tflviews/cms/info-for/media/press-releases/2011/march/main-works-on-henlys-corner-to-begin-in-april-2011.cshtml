        Work to significantly improve traffic flow at Henlys Corner junction will begin on 4 April.
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The scheme, being carried out by Transport for London (TfL), will provide much-needed and long anticipated improvement to the busy junction.</p>
<p>Right turns, which currently cause significant queues on the local roads, will also be upgraded, allowing cars to move forward and queue in a central area of the junction. </p>
<p>This will increase the number of vehicles that can pass through the junction, helping to smooth traffic flow through the area.&nbsp;<br></p>
<h2>Planned improvements</h2>
<p>New signal controlled crossings will also be installed, making crossing the road easier for pedestrians and cyclists.</p>
<p>Lane restrictions and temporary traffic management will be put in place to ensure traffic can continue to travel throughout the area while these works are carried out.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Mayor of London has prioritised the scheme because of the broad range of benefits for pedestrians, cyclists, traffic flow and improving the public realm.<br></p>
<h2>See the public exhibition for more information</h2>
<p>To help provide more detail about the work phasing and the measures TfL will be putting in place to reduce disruption while these improvements are taking place, a public exhibition about the scheme is being held at Chalgrove Primary School, Chalgrove Gardens, N3 3PL at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wednesday 16 March, 17:30-20:00 </li>
<li>Thursday 17 March, 17:30-20:00</li>
<li>Saturday 19 March, 12:00-15:00 </li>
<li>Sunday 20 March, 11:00-15:00</li></ul>
<p>Work on the &pound;8m scheme is expected to be completed by the end of the year.</p>
