                            2,000 tonnes of grit have been spread across the capital's roads

            <p>"We have worked tirelessly from Saturday afternoon onwards, gritting the Capital's main roads every few hours and clearing snow and ice from the London Underground network."</p>
<p>"All of London's strategic road network, and the vast majority of the Capital's other major routes, have been open since first thing this morning. We are running 100% of buses with only a small number of route curtailments or diversions, trains are operating across all lines on the Tube network except where there is planned upgrade work taking place, with around 97% of scheduled services running and 2,000 tonnes of grit have been spread across the capital's roads."</p>
<p>"London has remained open for business today, and we will be out in force again this evening and over night clearing snow and de-icing the Tube, DLR and London Overground networks and gritting London's strategic routes with thousands of tonnes of salt. We will be doing everything we can to ensure as smooth a start as possible to the week ahead."</p>
<p>"I would ask people to take care on the roads, to allow plenty of time for their journeys and to check the TfL website for the latest travel information."</p>
