<p>By the beginning of October, three cross track projection units will be installed at Euston station on the Victoria line platform five, for a four-week observation period.</p>
<p>Cross track projection (XTP) advertising is a new technology that allows moving advertising messages to be digitally projected onto the wall opposite the platforms in high definition.</p>
<p>The initial observation period will enable final testing of the system. </p>
<p>Once complete, and provided the conclusions are satisfactory, the new technology will be rolled out across 24 major&nbsp;LU stations with 150 units to be installed from early 2008.</p>
<p>Richard Parry, LU's Director of Service Development, said: "London Underground has a proud history of innovation and we're delighted to be working with CBS Outdoor to pioneer this technology in the UK. </p>
<h2>Enhance travel</h2>
<p>"We hope that our passengers will welcome this technology and that it will enhance their travel experience through the provision of versatile and entertaining advertising on the Underground.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"The new advertising media is expected to increase advertising revenues for London Underground which will be reinvested in the improvement of the Underground network."</p>
<p>The system, which is visual only, will initially show a selection of images from LU and CBS Outdoor. </p>
<p>Ultimately the new advertising media is expected to increase advertising revenues for LU which will be reinvested in the improvement of the Underground network.</p>
<p>The replacement of cross-track bill posting will also bring significant environmental benefits with a reduction in paper and paste, which renders the paper adverts non-recyclable.&nbsp; Around 4.1 tonnes of waste per year will be saved from landfills. </p>
<h2>Important milestone</h2>
<p>Andrew Oldham, Chief Operating Officer, CBS Outdoor, comments: "XTP is the most eagerly awaited of our new digital products for London Underground and it will be a very proud moment for me and all those involved in this project to see XTP go live.</p>
<p>"The observation period is an important milestone in the programme and a precursor to the commercial launch. </p>
<p>"Full production of the final sleeker and more compact projection units will begin following the observation period."</p>
