                            Oyster has cut queues at Tube stations and speeded up buses across London.

<p>The campaign, announced by the Mayor last month, offered 100,000 'free' Oyster cards (that is without the normal &pound;3 deposit) on a 'first come first served' basis.</p>
<p>The cards were given away through national, local and community press adverts, targeting communities where take-up is lowest.</p>
<p>The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: "This campaign has proved to be incredibly popular with an additional 100,000 people now able to enjoy the benefits of Oyster.</p>
<p>"With more than 10 million cards issued since its launch in 2003, the vast majority of Londoners are already using Oyster, which&nbsp;provides cheaper and more convenient journeys. </p>
<p>"Oyster has cut queues at Tube stations and speeded up buses across London."</p>
<h2>Latest figures</h2>
<p>More than three-quarters of all Tube and bus journeys are now made using Oyster.</p>
<p>The latest figures show that the number of single journeys now paid for by cash is extremely low, just 4 per cent on London Underground and 2.5 per cent on buses.</p>
<p>Single fares are always cheaper using Oyster. For example, a single bus fare using Oyster is &pound;1 compared to the &pound;2 cash fare.</p>
<p>A single Tube fare in Zone 1 is &pound;1.50 with Oyster compared to &pound;4 if cash is used.</p>
<p>In fact, Oyster prices have been held down so that they are still the same price as cash fares when Ken Livingstone was first elected Mayor of London nearly seven years ago.</p>
<h2>Oyster is still available </h2>
<p>The offer is now closed but Oyster is still available <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/oyster">online</a>, over the phone via 0845 330 9876, at Tube station ticket offices or at Travel Information Centres across London.</p>
<p>You can find your nearest Oyster outlet through the TfL website.</p>
<p>Calls from BT landlines cost 3.5p per minute.</p>
<p>Calls from mobiles and other networks may vary.</p>
            <p><strong>Notes to editors<br></strong>
<ul>
<li>A single Tube fare using Oyster is &pound;1.50 in Zone 1 and between Zones 1-2 off-peak - compared to &pound;4 using cash </li>
<li>The campaign has been across a range of publications, offering 100,000 cards minus the normal &pound;3 deposit to non Oyster users </li>
<li>More than 10 million Oyster cards have now been issued and 38 million journeys a week are made each week using Oyster </li>
<li>Almost three times as many passengers can pass an Underground ticket barrier using Oyster card as can using printed tickets - 40 a &nbsp;minute compared to 15 a minute </li>
<li>Oyster is available to buy or be topped up at all 275 Tube stations, and there are also more than 2,200 Oyster Ticket Stops agents &nbsp;across the Capital. Eighty-five percent of all Londoners live within 400 metres of an Oyster Ticket Stop </li>
<li>Passengers can also register the card so that the money is protected if the card is lost or stolen. Less ticket touts mean more secure stations </li>
<li>If you use Oyster to pay as you go, you can load cash on your Oyster card. When you touch in and out at the yellow readers on the &nbsp;Tube and Docklands Light Railway or touch in on the tram or bus, the reader automatically deducts the correct fare </li>
<li>Passengers can store up to three different Travelcards or Bus Pass season tickets and pay as you go on the same Oyster card at&nbsp;the same time. Oyster card technology is also used to provide free travel for Londoners aged over 60 or with an eligible disability &nbsp;through the Freedom Pass scheme. On the buses and trams, under-18s in full-time education can also get Oyster photocards for free travel. </li>
<li>When passengers use the Oyster card to touch in and out on the yellow readers on the TfL network it automatically works out the right &nbsp;fare for the journey within a fifth of a second working through up to 1.83 million possible options.</li></ul>
