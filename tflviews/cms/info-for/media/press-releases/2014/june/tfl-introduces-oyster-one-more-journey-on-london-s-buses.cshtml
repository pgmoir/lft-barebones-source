        <p>Transport for London (TfL)
        has announced that it will introduce Oyster 'One More Journey' from Sunday 8
        June, allowing passengers to make one more bus journey should they have
        insufficient pay as you go credit to travel.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>This new facility supports
        the move to cash free bus travel, which is being introduced across the
        capital's bus network from Sunday 6 July. </p>
        <p>It was developed following extensive
        research which showed nine out of ten passengers who paid a cash fare did so
        because either had insufficient pay as go credit to travel or had left their
        Oyster card at home.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Its introduction is one
        month earlier than planned and follows a successful trial on around 500 buses
        operating on 60 routes in the capital.</p>
        <p>Since the trial started, around
        1,500 passengers a day have benefited from the added convenience this facility
        gives, ensuring they can continue their onward journey whether it's to get them
        home or to the nearest Oyster Ticket Stop where they can top up for future
        travel.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The new feature is available
        to any passenger who presents an Oyster card for travel that has a positive
        balance but insufficient credit to pay for their bus journey.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>They
        receive an emergency fare advice slip to acknowledge that the Oyster 'One More
        Journey' feature has been used and to remind them that their card needs to be
        topped up before another journey can be made.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Passengers using rear door
        Oyster readers on multi-entry buses, such as New Routemasters, will be prompted
        to speak to the driver and use the reader at the front of bus to receive their
        emergency fare advice slip.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>This 'One More Journey' emergency fare will
        take the Oyster card into a negative balance which will be cleared when the pay
        as you go balance is topped up.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Mike Weston, TfL Director of
        Buses, said: &quot;During our trial over 77,000 journeys were enabled because of
        Oyster 'One More Journey' with positive feedback received from both passengers
        and bus drivers.&nbsp; Introducing this facility is the first of many steps we
        are taking to ensure a smooth transition to cash free bus travel from 6 July when
        passengers will benefit from quicker boarding and the guarantee of always
        paying the cheapest fare for their journey by paying with an Oyster or
        contactless payment card.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Oyster 'One More Journey' is
        one of a number of initiatives that are being introduced to ensure there is a
        smooth and trouble free transition for customers to cash free bus travel.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Others include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The Oyster Ticket Stop network
            has been subject to a review and additional locations added &#45; particularly
            in outer London</li>
            <li>Refreshed guidance on vulnerable
            passengers is being provided to all 24,500 London bus drivers</li>
            <li>A major public information
            campaign has launched to provide passengers with advice on the changes
            &nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The decision to move to cash
        free bus travel follows a considerable drop in the number of people paying
        their bus fare in cash.&nbsp; In 2000 around 25 per cent of journeys were paid
        for with a cash fare, today that figure stands at less than one per cent. With extensive use of Oyster and over 14 million journeys having now been made
        using contactless payment cards, cash usage is expected to fall even further as
        more customers take advantage of the convenience and cheaper fares these
        provide.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>This change will not affect
        99 per cent of bus passengers who already pay for their journeys using Oyster,
        prepaid tickets, contactless payment cards or concessionary tickets.&nbsp;The
        latter group represents a third of all customers and includes children and young
        people, older and disabled people and the unemployed.&nbsp;&nbsp;TfL research
        shows this change is also unlikely to affect tourists as the vast majority use
        Oyster or a prepaid ticket to get around the capital.&nbsp;Removing cash fares
        will also speed up boarding times, leading to faster journeys and will also
        ensure customers benefit from the best value fare for each journey they
        make.</p>
         
         
        <hr />
         
        <ul>
            <li>The
            trial of Oyster 'One More Journey' commenced on 4 April 2014 on around 500
            buses operating on 60 routes.</li>
            <li>The
            public consultation on proposals to withdraw cash fare payments on London
            buses ran from 19 August until 11 October 2013 and attracted over 37,000
            responses. The consultation report can be viewed at: https://consultations.tfl.gov.uk/buses/cashless</li>
            <li>To
            ensure the correct card is charged for the journey, customers should
            ensure they present their Oyster or contactless payment card separately
            when touching in.&nbsp; Any customer with queries about the fare they have
            been charged should contact our Customer Services team on 0343 222 1234 or
            oysterenquiries&#64;tfl.gov.uk. </li>
            <li>It
            costs &pound;24 million a year to accept cash on London's buses.&nbsp; The
            removal of cash fares will deliver &pound;130m savings to 2022/23 and this will
            be reinvested in improving transport in the capital. </li>
            <li>Cash fares will not be accepted from 04:30 on Sunday 6
            July,&nbsp;the start of TfL's&nbsp; next fare charging period</li>
        </ul>
