        The latest figures on London Underground's performance have been published today by Transport for London (TfL).

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The figures, covering the period 8 January to 4 February, show that the percentage of scheduled services was 97.1 per cent. </p>
<p>Average delays for the financial year to date - as measured by the number of customer hours lost to disruption - are at their lowest since 2003/04, when TfL took responsibility for the Underground. </p>
<p>This period is the sixth consecutive period where delays are down compared to the equivalent periods during the last financial year.<br>&nbsp;<br>The latest figures also show accessibility improvements around the network, with more than 98 per cent of lifts available at LU stations during the period.</p>
<p>Work included returning Earl's Court to full step-free status, with lifts there returned to service four months ahead of schedule following a nine-month programme of works to increase lift reliability.&nbsp;</p>
