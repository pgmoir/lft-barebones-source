            <p>A London Underground spokesperson said: "The RMT is threatening to strike over the implementation of a shorter, 35-hour five-day working week on London Underground.</p>
<p>"This is an agreement that they campaigned for and signed over a year ago, hailing it as a 'groundbreaking' deal.</p>
<p>"It was endorsed by their General Secretary, Executive Council and Tube membership by a margin of 30-1.</p>
<p>"London Underground and the RMT agreed to implement a shorter working week, as long as it came at no extra cost to the Tube farepayers.</p>
<p>"This means some staff being redeployed from ticket offices to station platforms and ticket halls, which can also boost reassurance for our passengers and security.</p>
<p><!-- #EndEditable -->"There will be no overall cuts in staff numbers.</p>
<p>"The continued success of Oyster had led to a significant reduction in the demand for paper tickets, reducing the need for the same number of staff in ticket offices."</p>
<p>Earlier, the <a href="http://www.rmt.org.uk" target="_blank">RMT</a> had announced that it has resolved its dispute with Metronet and withdrawn the separate threat of strike action in the week before Christmas.</p>
<p>The new ballot result is due on 22 December.</p>
