                            As soon as this problem arose, we demanded action from Tube Lines and Alstom

            <p>A spokesperson for LU said: "London Underground is as frustrated with the suspension of the Northern line as our passengers. </p>
<p>"The situation is intolerable and is bound up in the complex PPP/PFI contracts.<br><br>"As soon as this problem arose, we demanded action from Tube Lines and Alstom. </p>
<p>"It is clear that maintenance of the Northern line train fleet was not being done to the correct standards.</p>
<p>"On Friday, after we were provided with just half the Northern line train fleet, we exercised our right to issue an Emergency Direction to Tube Lines, to direct and oversee maintenance. </p>
<p>"This is the first time such action has been taken under PPP.</p>
<p>"We initiated a design review and believe we have developed a modified design for the trip-cock component at the root of this issue. </p>
<p>"We expect the Northern line service to be reinstated as these modifications are completed.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, we will not take action against Northern line drivers who refuse to work on grounds of safety. </p>
<p>"We of course expect them to help to provide information to disrupted passengers, and to move empty trains double staffed to depots, to help us quickly restore the Northern line."</p>
<h2>Passenger advice</h2>
<p>London Underground also issued the following advice to Northern line passengers:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Northern line will remain suspended for the rest of today and is likely to remain suspended throughout tomorrow 
</li><li>Passengers should seek alternative Tube, bus and rail routes. LU tickets will be accepted on all alternative services 
</li><li>We are also providing a number of alternative bus services, picking up at station served only by the Northern line, particularly in North London, to link with other Tube lines<br></li></ul>
