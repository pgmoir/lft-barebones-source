<p>Saturday 11 August will be another packed day of cultural and sporting events, with action taking place across the city, with Race Walks in central London, football in Wembley and spectators travelling between Greenwich Park and the Olympic Park to watch Modern Pentathlon and Diving events. </p>
<p>This comes as the transport network continues to serve record numbers of passengers as Londoners and visitors make the most of London's attractions. </p>
<p>Over the 12 days of the Olympic period starting Saturday 28 July, London Underground carried 46.95 million journeys&nbsp;-&nbsp;an increase of 11.05 million (30 per cent) compared with the same period last year. </p>
<p>Weekend Tube traffic has seen the biggest percentage increase with last Sunday being 77 per cent&nbsp;higher than last year, and Tuesday saw more than 4.5 million Tube journeys - the highest number in the Tube's history. </p>
<h2>Continue to plan ahead</h2>
<p>This Saturday, the men's Race Walk starting at 09:00 and finishing at 13:00 and the women's Race Walk starting at 17:00 and finishing at 19:00 will mean that areas around Constitution Hill, Buckingham Palace and The Mall will be exceptionally busy.</p>
<p>Public transport to and from Olympic venues will be very busy and people should plan ahead.</p>
<p>As some events continue into the evening spectators are reminded to check times of their last train home and non-spectators are urged to continue avoiding the busiest stations at the busiest times.&nbsp; </p>
<p>To plan journeys, visit <a href="http://www.GetAheadoftheGames.com">www.GetAheadoftheGames.com</a>. </p>
<h2>Invigorating</h2>
<p>Hyde Park and Victoria Park Live Sites will be bursting with Olympic atmosphere again on Saturday. </p>
<p>There are a number of stations that can be used to access the Hyde Park Live Site including Bond Street, Marble Arch and Green Park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marble Arch and Hyde Park stations will operate flexibly and may become exit only if they are busy.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Victoria Park can be accessed from Mile End station.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE, said: 'It is hard to believe that Saturday's events will mean we are just one day before the London 2012 Olympic Games draw to a close. </p>
<h2>Wealth of opportunities</h2>
<p>'Once again we will see another day of invigorating sporting events, the Jubilee and Metropolitan lines will be full of colour as Brazilian and Mexican football fans make their way to Wembley to watch the final. </p>
<p>'We're incredibly grateful to Londoners for adapting their travel patterns throughout the Olympics. </p>
<p>'By travelling outside peak times or taking different routes, it's made a huge contribution to ensuring the success of the Games and keeping London moving.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'We will need to continue to keep this sensible planning going, avoiding the busiest times and places, as we enter the Paralympics in just 19 days time.<br>&nbsp;<br>'This summer presents a huge wealth of opportunities spanning sport and culture and Londoners and visitors should take advantage of the many theatres, restaurants, shops, free concerts, Live Sites and attractions that the capital has to offer. </p>
<h2>Re-check your plans</h2>
<p>'The Race Walk's in central London will be exciting to watch, as will the sailing in Weymouth,&nbsp; so I would urge people to use GetAheadoftheGames.com to plan their journeys to Games events, wherever in London or the UK the Games venue is.'</p>
<p>Looking ahead to Sunday's Closing Ceremony, Westfield Stratford City shopping centre will, after 8pm, only be accessible to accredited workers and members of the public with or collecting Games tickets or attending hospitality venues. </p>
<p>All other passengers should avoid the shopping centre at that time and enjoy the shopping and attractions at the numerous other locations across London.</p>
<p><strong>Ticketed spectators</strong></p><strong>
