            <p>"The RMT is threatening to strike over the implementation of a shorter 35-hour, five-day working week on London Underground. </p>
<p>"This is an agreement that they campaigned for and signed over a year ago, and which was endorsed by their General Secretary, Executive Council and Tube membership by a margin of 30-1.</p>
<p>"London Underground and the RMT agreed to implement a shorter working week, as long as it came at no extra cost to the Tube farepayers. </p>
<p>"This means some staff being redeployed from ticket offices to station platforms and ticket halls, which can also boost reassurance for our passengers and security.</p>
<p>"There will be no overall cut in staff numbers. </p>
<p>"The continued success of Oyster had led to a significant reduction in the demand for paper tickets - one million fewer paper tickets each week - reducing the need for the same number of staff in ticket offices.</p>
<p>"We hope this can be resolved without the need for strike action."</p>
