        Sixth bus route in the capital to operate entirely with the world's greenest diesel electric hybrid buses

 <div class="on-this-page">

        <ul>
            <li>Seventh bus route &#45; the route 38 and night
            service N38 &#45; will be next to convert to running with New Routemasters
            &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>From Saturday 26 April route 10
        will become the latest in the capital to be served entirely by New
        Routemasters.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>These are the cleanest and greenest diesel electric hybrid
        buses in the world and are part of a comprehensive programme to reduce
        emissions from London's bus fleet.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Currently, five bus routes
        in London are served by around 140 New Routemasters.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>By 2016 there will
        be 600 of these new buses on London's streets.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Route 10, which runs 24-hours a day
        and is operated by London United, runs between Hammersmith Bus Station and
        King's Cross St Pancras via Olympia, High Street Kensington, Knightsbridge,
        Hyde Park Corner, Marble Arch, Oxford Circus, Tottenham Court Road and Euston.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Buses on route 10 will operate with
        the rear door open and a conductor on the rear platform for the majority of the
        day on weekdays (6am&#45;6pm Monday to Friday).&nbsp; </p>
        <p>In the evenings and at
        weekends the rear platform will be closed when the bus is moving but all three
        sets of doors will be open and closed by the driver at bus stops.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>During
        peak hours, 23 of the new buses will be in passenger service to carry the
        19,000 people who travel on the route each week
        day.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The next route to be converted will
        be the 38 along with night service N38, operated by Arriva, which will see more
        New Routemasters being introduced on a phased basis, with full conversion
        expected by the end of May.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>It was the route on which the first prototype
        New Routemaster entered service in February 2012.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The route 38 runs
        between Victoria Station and Hackney, via Hyde Park Corner, Green Park,
        Piccadilly Circus, Bloomsbury, Islington, Dalston, Hackney Central Station and
        Clapton Pond.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>The route N38, which operates at night, has an extended
        service running additionally via Lea Bridge, Leyton (Bakers Arms) and
        Walthamstow Central.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Once converted, buses on route 38
        will operate with the rear door open and a conductor on the rear platform for
        the majority of the day on weekdays (6am&#45;7pm Monday to Friday) on the busiest
        section of the route between Islington and Victoria. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>On the remainder of
        the route, in the evenings and at weekends the rear platform will be closed
        when the bus is moving but all three sets of doors will be open and closed by
        the driver at bus stops. &nbsp;</p>
        <p>During peaks hours, 59 of these state of the art
        buses will be in passenger service to carry the 42,000 people who travel on the
        route each week day.&nbsp;
        &nbsp;

        <ul>
            <li>The introduction of the New Routemaster is part
            of a comprehensive programme to reduce emissions from London's bus fleet with
            1,700 hybrids on the street by 2016, accelerating the introduction of ultra low
            emission Euro VI buses and retrofitting 900 older buses to reduce their NOx
            emissions by up to 80 per cent</li>
            <li>In tests a New Routemaster prototype bus was
            found to emit a quarter of the NOx (Oxides of Nitrogen) and harmful 'PM'
            particles of a fleet average hybrid bus and 20 per cent less CO2.&nbsp; When all 600 are in service in 2016 they will reduce CO2 emissions
            in the capital by around 20,600 tonnes a year</li>
            <li>London
            United is a wholly owned subsidiary of RATP Dev SA, which operates public
            transportation in over 12 countries.&nbsp; The London United network of routes
            covers central, west and south west London</li>
            <li>Arriva is part of Deutsche Bahn, one of the
            world's leading passenger transport and logistics service providers, and
            operates in 14 European countries.&nbsp; Headquartered in Sunderland, Arriva is
            responsible for Deutsche Bahn's regional passenger transport services outside
            of Germany</li>
            <li>These buses are manufactured by the family-owned
            Wrightbus company in Northern Ireland.&nbsp; The order for 600 vehicles
            resulted in the opening of a new chassis plant in Antrim and the safeguarding
            of 220 jobs, including 18 apprenticeships and the creation of 50 new jobs</li>
            <li>As well as the manufacture of the chassis and
            superstructure in Northern Ireland, a number of components for the bus are made
            by companies from around the UK; including engines from Darlington, seats from
            Telford, seat moquette from Huddersfield, wheelchair ramps from Hoddesdon
            (Hertfordshire), destination blinds from Middleton near Manchester and flooring
            from Liskeard (Cornwall).&nbsp; All of these companies have received a boost as
            a result of the new bus project</li>
        </ul>
