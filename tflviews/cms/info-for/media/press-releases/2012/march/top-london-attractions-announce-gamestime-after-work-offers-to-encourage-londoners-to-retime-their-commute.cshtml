            <p>A host of top London attractions announced today (Wednesday 7 March) that they will provide special 'after work' offers during the London 2012 Games to encourage people working in Games transport 'hotspot' areas to travel home outside peak hours.</p>
<p>Organisations including The Sanctuary Spa, Madame Tussauds London and West End theatres showing smash-hits including The Phantom Of The Opera, The 39 Steps and Mamma Mia! will offer deals to people working locally to encourage them to enjoy an evening out during the Games.</p>
<p>The participating companies outlined their offers at a breakfast event organised by Transport for London (TfL) and London 2012 for the capital's business community to discuss what they are doing to get 'Games-ready'. </p>
<p>These offers include:</p>
<ul>
<li>After work theatre tickets starting at &pound;10 from the Society of London Theatre&nbsp;(SOLT) for a range of West End shows through a major promotion to be announced in the spring </li>
<li>Special offers and spa packages from The Sanctuary Spa which is offering late night opening during the working week </li>
<li>Early morning and late night VIP tours at Madame Tussauds London from Merlin Entertainments Group </li>
<li>30 per cent off normal priced cinema tickets after work at Apollo Cinemas, Piccadilly</li></ul>
<p>More than 200 senior business and stakeholder representatives attending this morning's event heard speeches from Deloitte, the Department for Transport, SOLT and TfL who all discussed how their organisations are preparing for the Games. </p>
<p>Kieran West MBE, Olympic medal winning rower, also spoke about his personal experience of winning a Gold medal at the Sydney 2000 Games and how effective travel planning by businesses and commuters can benefit athletes. </p>
<h2>Top attractions</h2>
<p>Ben Plowden, Director of Surface Planning at TfL, said: 'London will be a hugely exciting place to be this summer with a fantastic spectacle of sporting and cultural events. </p>
<p>'We know that at certain times and in certain locations the public transport network will be much busier than usual. </p>
<p>'That's why we are teaming up with a range of London's top attractions to ensure that people able to travel home outside peak hours on the busiest days are spoilt for choice when deciding how to spend their evening. </p>
<p>'We will continue to work closely with London's businesses to ensure they have all the information they need to get ahead of the Games, and encourage businesses of all sizes to consider what offers they could provide to encourage those in travel 'hot spots' to make the most of the opportunities the Games will bring.' </p>
<h2>Reduced price tickets</h2>
<p>Julian Bird, Chief Executive of the SOLT who hosted a panel debate at this morning's business event, said: 'When the 2012 Games get under way, many employees in transport hot spot locations will be looking to re-time their commute and enjoy the festival atmosphere.</p>
<p>'To help, we will be providing them with reduced priced tickets to some of the best theatre shows around through our new spring promotion and at tkts in Leicester Square, London.</p>
<p>'I'd urge other businesses to follow our lead and give commuters a range of options to enjoy their summer evenings in the city.'</p>
<p>TfL and London 2012 are encouraging more businesses to introduce offers during the Games, with full details of all the offers - and how to redeem them - available at <a href="http://www.GetAheadoftheGames.com">http://www.GetAheadoftheGames.com</a> and the official &#64;GAOTG Twitter feed in June. </p>
<h2>Site-specific advice</h2>
<p>TfL and London 2012 provide free travel advice to business programmes to companies operating in areas of London and the rest of the UK that will be affected by the Games. </p>
<p>More than 500 major companies, employing more than 600,000 people, have already benefited from tailored, site-specific advice.&nbsp; </p>
<p>A further 700 businesses employing 200 people or less have already attended area based workshops, while around 100 companies employing more than 200 people at multiple locations have attended or will be attending themed workshops to assist them.</p>
