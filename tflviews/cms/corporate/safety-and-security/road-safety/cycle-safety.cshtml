        Our Cycle Safety Action Plan is designed to to encourage people to cycle more by making London's roads as safe as possible for cyclists. It covers everything from building cycle-friendly roads to developing new technology to protect people on bikes.

<p>The objectives of the plan are to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ensure the growth of cycling in London is accompanied by a reduced rate of cycling casualties</li>
	<li>Increase the perception that cycling is a safe and attractive transport option</li>
	<li>Make progress towards achieving existing and future targets for reducing cyclists killed or seriously injured</li>
	<li>Ensure London continues to be a world leader in developing effective cycling safety improvements, underpinned by analysis and a sound understanding of the causes of collisions</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are three examples of our Cycle Safety Action Plan in action:</p>

<h2>Crossrail lorry training</h2>

<p>Large numbers of lorry drivers are working on the Crossrail project. To make sure they drive safely near cyclists, we give truck drivers special cycle awareness training.</p>

<h2>Goods vehicle technology</h2>

<p>We're encouraging heavy goods vehicle operators to fit special cycle safety technology on their vehicles. This includes sensors and cameras that tell a driver when a cyclist or pedestrian is near.</p>

This includes sensors and cameras that tell a driver when a cyclist or pedestrian is near. <a href="/info-for/deliveries-in-london/delivering-safely">Find out more about goods vehicle safety</a>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cycle Skills</h2>

<p>Whether you're a first-time rider or a regular cyclist looking to improve your skills, we fund <a href="/modes/cycling/cycle-skills">free, tailored courses</a> to suit your individual abilities and&nbsp;goals. Free to anyone who lives, works or studies in London.</p>

<h2>Exchanging Places events</h2>

<p>Did you know we offer Exchanging Places to make Heavy Goods Vehicle (HGV) drivers, bus drivers and cyclists more aware of one another on London's roads? These events give cyclists the opportunity to sit in the driver's seat of a HGV or bus and see what the driver can and cannot see at the kerbside and directly in front of their vehicle.</p>

<p>Exchanging Places can also be done as a virtual reality experience. Mobile headsets that allow up to 10 people to participate at once are accessible for all ages.</p>

<p>Email <a href="mailto:exchanging.places&#64;met.police.uk">exchanging.places&#64;met.police.uk</a> to ask about attending an Exchanging Places event.</p>

<h2>Vision Zero for London</h2>

<p>We are&nbsp;committed to reducing road danger, by working in partnership with the police, London boroughs and stakeholders to achieve the Vision Zero ambition of creating a road network free from death and serious injury by 2041. <a href="/corporate/safety-and-security/road-safety/vision-zero-for-london">Read more information on Vision Zero.</a></p>
