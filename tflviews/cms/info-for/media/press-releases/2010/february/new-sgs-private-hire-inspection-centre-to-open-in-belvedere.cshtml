 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The SGS private hire vehicle (PHV) inspection centre in Woolwich will be moving to a new site in the Belvedere Industrial Estate in March.</p>
<p>The Woolwich site has been compulsory purchased to facilitate the construction of the Woolwich Crossrail station.</p>
<p>SGS will be opening the new inspection centre on 1 March 2010 at Unit 6, OYO Industrial Estate, Crabtree Manorway North, Belvedere, DA17 6AX.<strong><p>
<h2>New larger site</h2></strong>
<p>The centre will be open from Monday to Thursday 08:00 to 16:30 and Friday 08:00 to 15:30.</p>
<p>The new site will be larger and incorporates an additional inspection lane. </p>
<p>Increased parking facilities will also be available and the one-way single lane testing facility will improve vehicle flow.</p>
<p>An application for the Belvedere site to become a VOSA approved MOT testing station is underway and due to be approved in April. </p>
<h2>Maps on display</h2>
<p>Once approved, the site will be able to undertake mechanical unfit compliance inspections for private hire vehicles.</p>
<p>A map showing the location of the new centre will be sent out to all vehicle owners who have been allocated a licensing inspection at Belvedere. </p>
<p>The map will also be on display at all other PHV inspection centres. </p>
<p>Further information on the move can be obtained by contacting SGS on 020 8755 2368.<br></p><strong>
