        TfL volunteer army steps up to support the Capital during unnecessary Tube strike

 <div class="on-this-page">
<ul>
    <li>No Tube services running today due to strike action</li>
    <li>Hundreds of travel ambassadors available across the Capital to help Londoners, visitors and tourists get to their destinations</li>
    <li>Extra bus and river services running to help people get around, and all public transport and roads are expected to be much busier than usual, especially during peak hours</li>
    <li>Buses do not accept cash so customers will need to use contactless payment, Oyster or a bus pass</li>
    <li>Additional Santander Cycles hubs are in place at key central London locations to make cycling an easy option</li>
    <li>Customers are advised to check before they travel at <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike">tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike</a> and by following &#64;TfLTravelAlerts, &#64;TfLTrafficNews and &#64;TfLBusAlerts on Twitter</li>
</ul>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) has today deployed a volunteer army to help people get around the Capital following strike action by the trade unions, which means no Tube services are running. Tube services are expected to run as normal tomorrow.</p>
<p>Staff on the DLR, London Overground, the bus network, tram and TfL Rail services are not on strike. These services are running as normal, but they will be much busier than usual and customers are strongly advised, if possible, to travel outside of the morning and evening peaks.</p>
<p>Many locations in central London are easily accessible from mainline rail stations, and TfL will have more than 600 travel ambassadors on hand to help Londoners, visitors and tourists get to their destinations on foot, by bus, by Santander Cycles or by other means.  Around 250 extra buses are being provided to boost capacity on the main commuter corridors and to and from mainline stations and additional Santander Cycles hubs will mean more bikes will be available at the busiest locations. Extra river services are also being provided during peak hours today. These services will be very busy and customers are asked to bear with the transport staff who are at work and trying to help them get around.</p>
<p>London Underground (LU) has tried everything possible to engage the unions over the last six months to try to reach an agreement on pay and the introduction of the Night Tube 24-hour Underground services at weekends from September. We have listened to their concerns over work-life balance and put forward an extremely fair revised offer with the following guarantees:</p>
<ul>
    <li>No-one will be asked to work more hours than they do today to run the Night Tube</li>
    <li>Every driver on the Night Tube will have the same, if not more, weekends off as they do now during the transition year</li>
    <li>After that, they will have a choice about whether or not they work Night Tube shifts or not</li>
    <li>Everybody will remain entitled to two days off in seven</li>
    <li>Annual leave for staff will remain significantly above the national average &#45; 43 days for a train operator, 52 days for a member of our station staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, staff will continue to be able to exercise choice, swapping shifts to get the type of work-life balance they want. LU has also offered an above-inflation pay rise this year and guaranteed rises for the next two years, as well as a Night Tube bonus and &pound;200 per shift for drivers working Night Tube shifts during the transition period.</p>
<p>Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: </p>
<p>'I am sorry that the unions have rejected our extremely fair offer outright and that the journeys of our customers will be disrupted today. We have a volunteer army of hundreds on hand to help London's workers, residents and visitors get around during the strike. I thank customers for their patience as they make their journeys today.</p>
<p>&quot;We have made every effort to reach agreement with the unions and avoid this unnecessary strike action. We have employed 137 new drivers and 345 new station staff for the Night Tube service. We've made work-life balance guarantees that no-one will work extra hours and that drivers will have the same number of weekends off as now and will be able to choose whether they work Night Tube shifts in future.'</p>

    <li>Journey times will be cut by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour.</li>
