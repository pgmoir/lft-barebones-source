<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced &pound;2.5m for Sutton to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.</p>
<p>The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>The &pound;2.5m funding package in 2013/14 in Sutton will finance a range of transport projects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;259,000 to promote sustainable travel by improving the transport network in the Worcester Park and North Cheam area in line with the Mayor's vision for Better Streets.&nbsp;This will involve improving accessibility and the public realm in Worcester Park in order to promote local shopping trips and hence reduce car journeys</li>
<li>&pound;150,000 for the Beddington Lane Regeneration Project. Money will help fund an ongoing project to upgrade 2km of Beddington Lane to improve accessibility to the Beddington Strategic Industrial Estate for local economic growth as well as encouraging sustainable modes of travel and public transport</li>
<li>&pound;741,000 to improve the area around Sutton station making it easier and safer for people to access the station and interchange between different transport services</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:&nbsp;'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Sutton.&nbsp;'A world-class city deserves a world-class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'</p>
<p>This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be coordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said:&nbsp;'We are working in partnership with Sutton and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>Last year in Sutton, it funded 42 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 1,792 children and 73 adults, 28 accessible bus stops, for 40 schools to participate in walking events and 114 new street trees.</p>
<p>Notable larger projects undertaken this year include &pound;159,000 for a package of Smarter Travel measures, including travel plans for schools and businesses and the provision of safe routes to schools. </p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<p>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp; While individual projects&nbsp;are&nbsp;the responsibility of each borough.</p>
