<p>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has announced &pound;220m funding for boroughs to deliver transport, town centre and public space improvements to improve the lives of Londoners.</p>
<p>The funding will be used by boroughs across the Capital for a wide range of projects to reduce dangers on the roads, transform local areas, encourage cycling and walking and improve air quality.</p>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) will invest &pound;148m in Local Implementation Plans that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, as well as a further &pound;70m for other schemes, including funding for strategic walking and cycling programmes such as Quietways, Mini-Hollands and Liveable Neighbourhoods.  This will be key to delivering the Mayor's Healthy Streets vision of a city that is more pleasant to live and move around in.</p>
<p>Each of London's 33 boroughs benefits from the funding, with more than &pound;1bn to be invested across TfL's Business Plan to 2021/22, in which the Mayor announced record levels of investment to make cycling easier and safer, including support for borough cycling schemes, and improve the capital's air quality.</p>
<p>This year's Local Implementation Plan funding for boroughs in South London includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bexley - &pound;1.9m including &pound;500,000 for local safety measures to reduce the number of collisions in the borough, in particular safety issues around schools including parking enforcement;</li>
    <li>Bromley &#45; &pound;3.5m including &pound;1m to revamp Beckenham Town Centre, improving and making the local shopping area easier to navigate for pedestrians. This is in addition to junction improvements recently completed at the Albemarle Road/Rectory Road junction;</li>
    <li>Croydon - &pound;2.9m including &pound;750,000 for public realm improvements in South Norwood town centre, such as widening and decluttering footways and cycle paths to enhance pedestrian and cyclist accessibility and experience;</li>
    <li>Greenwich - &pound;2.6m including &pound;130,000 for upgrading cycle lanes and tracks in the south of the Borough, as well as &pound;100,000 for a new Quietway link connecting Woolwich with Queen Elizabeth hospital;</li>
    <li>Kingston - &pound;2.4m including &pound;916,000 to deliver reconfigured crossing facilities and route approaches along Wood Street, complementing mini-Holland's proposals for the area and the Gloriana Major Scheme;</li>
    <li>Lambeth - &pound;3.8m including &pound;789,000 for works to change the public realm to make walking and cycling safer, more attractive and convenient way of travel for residents of and visitors to Norwood Road;</li>
    <li>Lewisham - &pound;3.9m including &pound;400,000 for improvements to the junction of Sangley Road and Sandhurst Road. The scheme will also consider an extension of the successful traffic calming, which was introduced to Sangley Road in 2010;</li>
    <li>Merton - &pound;2.9m including &pound;1.1m improve Mitcham town centre and surrounding junctions to address accessibility, safety, bus priority and road network issues;</li>
    <li>Richmond - &pound;1.8m including &pound;50,000 to revamp Richmond town centre and give the public realm a makeover to support economic vitality by improving road safety and congestion, creating better facilities for pedestrians and cyclists, as well as improving air quality;</li>
    <li>Southwark - &pound;2.7m including &pound;400,000 to deliver public realm improvements on Walworth Road by re-organising the road space, including a review of bus lane operation, introduction of signal pedestrian crossings, a central median and reducing the carriageway width to improve safety for pedestrians;</li>
    <li>Sutton - &pound;2.2m including &pound;800,000 to progress works for the Beddington Lane Regeneration scheme. In its second year now the scheme will address traffic congestion, as well as providing better facilities for pedestrians and cyclists once completed;</li>
    <li>Wandsworth - &pound;2.7m including &pound;300,000 to improve the public realm on Battersea High Street by removing old street furniture, giving the street market a makeover to boost local businesses and create shared space. The funding will also cover &pound;300,000 to improve pedestrian facilities in Southfields town centre to increase footfall, reduce street clutter, review parking and loading and provide good walkway links to the All England Club.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said: `I'm proud that through the new TfL Business Plan we are creating a modern and affordable transport network for the capital, and am delighted that we are able to invest an increased level of funding across the boroughs next year too. By making walking and cycling easier and safer, and funding projects that will improve air quality, we can help boroughs right across the capital to deliver transport and public space improvements that are going to make a real difference to the lives of Londoners.'</p>
<p>Councillor Julian Bell, Chair of London Councils Transport &amp; Environment Committee, said: `London's boroughs welcome this long term settlement by the Mayor of London, which will assist in making borough streets greener and safer. It provides a much needed firm base from which to work with the Mayor and TfL to deliver the improvements to London's local transport scene as part of a city for all Londoners.'</p>
<p>The Mayor and TfL will also work closely with boroughs in the New Year on a stronger offer of support to deliver the projects, and a review of where they are targeted to ensure they are delivered where they are most needed.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Mike Brown, said: `We will work closer than ever before with all London boroughs to ensure London remains a world-class city with more attractive, accessible and people-friendly streets. Through this funding, Londoners will see real improvements to their local areas, through safer streets, improved public areas, more reliable public transport and increased walking and cycling facilities.'</p>
<p>Significant projects in South London awarded funding last year included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bromley &#45; &pound;85,000 to improve safety on Warren Road / Windsor Drive junction and for works to improve safety for pedestrian and all road users outside Chelsfield rail station, as well as creation of a mini-roundabout on Copers Cope Road to address collisions and difficulties pedestrians have crossing the road to get to the station and nearby schools;</li>

    <li>Kingston - &pound;778,000 for Kingston Riverside public realm improvements, which will result in improved road safety and access to complement the wider redevelopment in the riverside area and the mini-Holland programme. The funding will also make a significant contribution to a once-in-a-lifetime cultural / heritage event - the permanent berthing of the Royal Barge Gloriana;</li>
    <li>Richmond - &pound;50,000 to review crossing facilities on Percy Road outside Twickenham Academy, linking in with improvements on the junction of Percy Road, Hospital Bridge Road and Powdermill Lane;</li>
