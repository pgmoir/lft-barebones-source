            <p>-&nbsp;Subways to be filled in by end of year, with the whole scheme completed by spring 2011<br>-&nbsp;Scheme supports the Mayor of London's vision for improving public spaces across the Capital<br></p>
<p>A key milestone in the regeneration of Elephant &amp; Castle will be delivered next weekend (8-10 October), when the southern roundabout will be converted to a traffic light-controlled junction, to help smooth traffic flow through the area.</p>
<p>Work to change the traffic layout began in July, and includes road resurfacing, installation of temporary traffic signals and realigning kerbs and road markings.</p>
<p>The project is being delivered as part of the Mayor of London's 'Great Outdoors' initiative, which is a &pound;220m programme to improve public spaces across the Capital. </p>
<h2>New cycle lanes</h2>
<p>Paved areas will also be widened, lighting will be improved and extra trees will be planted, while new cycle lanes and advanced stop lines for cyclists will also be installed in the local area.</p>
<p>During these works, there will be no access from Walworth Road to Elephant &amp; Castle. </p>
<p>Buses that normally use the junction will be placed on local diversion and serve all bus stops on the diversion routes if requested.</p>
<p>Full details of the bus diversions will be available at local bus stops and on the Transport for London (TfL) website. </p>
<p>Once the roundabout has been converted to a traffic light-controlled junction, work will begin to install new pedestrian crossings and to fill in the existing subway network underneath the roundabout. </p>
<p>The full scheme, including improvements to the public space around the area, should be completed by spring 2011. </p>
<p>Kulveer Ranger, the Mayor of London's Transport Advisor, said: 'The conversion of this mammoth roundabout into a junction will be a major step forward in the regeneration of this long neglected area. </p>
<p>'By smoothing the flow of traffic and improving public space around the Elephant &amp; Castle, we plan to transform the area into a more pleasant place for pedestrians, cyclists and local residents and businesses. </p>
<p>'This work is part of the Mayor's agenda to improve both the operation and look and feel of London.'</p>
<p>David Brown, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: "Work on the Elephant &amp; Castle southern roundabout is progressing at a fantastic pace, and the delivery of this key milestone is a major step forward in improving traffic flow through the area. </p>
<p>"Once the new traffic light controlled junction is installed, we can begin work to widen the current pavement space, as well as filling in the existing subway network and replacing it with new pedestrian crossings." </p>
<p>Councillor Fiona Colley, cabinet member for regeneration at Southwark Council, said: 'I'm delighted to be a step closer to getting rid of the unpopular and intimidating subways with this new milestone. </p>
<p>'Every new development brings us further towards the vision for Elephant &amp; Castle, and the improvements to the traffic layout is something that local people are keen to see happening as soon as possible. </p>
<p>'I'm looking forward to working with TfL to address the northern roundabout next.'</p>
<p>As part of Southwark Council's plans to regenerate Elephant &amp; Castle, TfL has also identified a need for significant improvements to the northern roundabout - part of a package of transport measures required for the wider regeneration of the area. </p>
<p>TfL is currently working with Southwark Council to finalise the details of these transport improvements.</p>

<li>TfL continues to work with Southwark Council and Lend Lease to finalise plans for the transport improvements required for the long-term regeneration of Elephant &amp; Castle. These transport improvements will be privately financed </li>
<li>TfL's feasibility study into the long-term transport needs of the area was completed in 2009 and identified a number of necessary transport improvements required to help support the regeneration of Elephant &amp; Castle. These included:&nbsp; 
<ul type="circle">
<li>Major capacity improvements to the Northern line ticket hall at Elephant &amp; Castle Underground station </li>
<li>Additional cycling and walking facilities throughout the area </li>
<li>Increased bus priority measures and interchange facilities </li>
<li>Further road improvements and changes to the northern roundabout in Elephant &amp; Castle</li></ul></li>
<li>Londoners can find out what roadworks are planned in their local area by visiting the LondonWorks website at <a href="http://public.londonworks.gov.uk">http://public.londonworks.gov.uk</a> </li>
<li>'London's Great Outdoors - A Manifesto for Public Space' is supported by two practical guides: 'Better Streets' and 'Better Green and Water Spaces'. Together they set out the Mayor of London's vision for improving public spaces in London. This will ensure that our streets, squares, parks and green and water spaces are fit for a great world city, are enjoyed by everyone who visits them and most importantly, help improve the quality of life in the Capital </li>
<li>They are accompanied by an implementation plan that will see &pound;220m invested in more than 50 public realm improvement projects during the next three years, funding for which comes from TfL, The London Development Agency and London's boroughs as well as other sources. The measures include redesigned streets, which can be shared by both pedestrians and vehicles, and reclaimed derelict green spaces and underused waterways </li>
<li>The manifesto and guides have been written and produced by the Greater London Authority, London Development Agency, Design for London and TfL.&nbsp;For further information please go to <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/greatoutdoors">www.london.gov.uk/greatoutdoors</a></li></ul>
