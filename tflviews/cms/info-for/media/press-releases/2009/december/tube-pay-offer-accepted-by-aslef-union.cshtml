            <p>London Underground (LU) has welcomed the overwhelming acceptance by ASLEF union members of the two-year, above-inflation pay offer which the company has put to all unions.</p>
<p>Seventy per cent of the union's members voted to accept the deal, which will see their pay increase by 1.5 per cent this year and RPI+ 0.5 per cent in spring 2010.</p>
<p>The offer had already been accepted by members of the TSSA union, who were 85 per cent in favour of the deal in October.</p>
<h2>Above-inflation increase</h2>
<p>Richard Parry, Managing Director of LU, said: 'I welcome ASLEF's acceptance of our pay offer, which guarantees above-inflation pay increases for staff over the next two years.'</p>
<p>LU also called on the RMT union's leadership to abandon its ballot for strike action, which will only lose its members more pay. </p>
<p>Richard Parry said: 'We have made a final, fair and affordable pay offer which would give our staff above-inflation pay rises for two years, in a challenging economic climate. </p>
<p>'I urge all of our unions to put this offer to their members with a recommendation to accept.'<br></p>
