        <ul>
            <li>The Tour de France, the world's largest
            annual sporting event, returns to London on Monday 7 July 2014</li>
            <li>School children across London are invited to
            get involved and take part in four Tour de France art competitions
            &nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>To celebrate the world's
        greatest cycling race returning to the capital on Monday 7 July, Lloyd Warbey,
        presenter of Disney's Art Attack, and Transport for London (TfL) are calling on
        school children across London to take inspiration from the world's best
        cyclists rolling through the city's streets and get arty.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The capital's students are
        being challenged to craft cycling creations in four separate competitions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students aged between 7 and 11 are being
            asked to design a banner and a cycling jersey. The winning banner design will
            be displayed at the Tour de France Fan Parks and the winning jersey design will
            be printed onto a jersey for the artist to keep</li>
            <li>Students aged between 11 and 14 are being
            asked to submit their designs for a cycling poster. The winning design will be
            displayed in secondary schools in London</li>
            <li>Students aged between 7 and 14 are being
            asked to design a piece of artwork which could include land art or a sculpture</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The winning piece will be brought to life and displayed at key landmarks across
        London.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Lloyd Warbey, presenter of
        Disney's Art Attack, said: &quot;As a born and bred Londoner, I am thoroughly
        excited about the great Tour de France coming to the capital on Monday 7 July,
        and the chance to be involved with the Tour and children's art was one I could
        not turn down. I'm looking forward to seeing the best cycling art London's
        pedalling Picassos have to offer.&quot;&nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        Leon Daniels, Managing
        Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: &quot;The inspirational Tour de France
        returns to London on Monday 7 July and will encourage Londoners and visitors to
        experience the capital on two wheels. Lloyd has seen some really big art
        attacks and I cannot wait to see how these competitions will provoke the
        artistic talent of London's youngsters.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The winners of each
        competition will be judged by a panel, including Lloyd, and will win a range of
        fantastic prizes to inspire and encourage more cycling including cycling
        equipment, official Tour de France merchandise, framed artwork and the chance
        to have the art displayed at London landmarks and City Hall. </p>

        and help to inspire more people to take up cycling.
        &nbsp;

            Lloyd
            Warbey stars in Disney's Art Attack. Art Attack is a unique and inspirational
            Arts and Craft show designed to spark imagination and creativity, with broad
            appeal that encourages self expression and individuality, demonstrating to
            children of all abilities that anyone can be an artist. More information on Art
            Attack can be found at http://www.disney.co.uk/disney-junior/art-attack</li>
            <li>TfL
            is undertaking an extensive programme of public engagement&nbsp;and
            communication for the arrival of the Tour de France. It is designed to ensure
            people living and working in London can understand the potential impacts of the
            Tour and plan ahead to avoid unnecessary inconvenience. The engagement
            activities include leaflet drops to residents and businesses along the route,
            work with the local boroughs and schools, local business engagement events and
            public information sessions</li>
            <li>The
            Mayor is committed to ensuring London retains its status as the world capital
            of sport, and has recently set up the Major Events Oversight Board. The board
            is chaired by Sir Edward Lister, and comprises of TfL, the emergency services
            and other key partner agencies. It provides strategic direction and advice to
            the Mayor on the approach to bidding, staging and evaluating major events in
            London. The board ensures that all major road events continue to be carefully
            considered and tightly managed to ensure everyone gets full benefit from the
            event without undue impact on Londoners and London's transport. The board also
            looks at ways to ensure the major events programme is effectively communicated
            with Londoners, visitors, businesses and stakeholders to allow sufficient
            notice and forward planning for everyone</li>
            <li>The
            detailed Tour de France route is available on the TfL website at
            tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance. In early summer the website will be updated to include
            a full list of road closures and timings. To avoid delays drivers are advised
            to, wherever possible, avoid areas&nbsp;near the event routes in the affected
            parts of Cambridgeshire, Essex and London. For up to date information on how
            transport services are operating, Londoners are advised to check before they
            travel at tfl.gov.uk and follow &#64;TfLTravelAlerts (Tube, DLR and London
            Overground), &#64;TfLTrafficNews (roads) and &#64;TfLBusAlerts (buses)</li>
            <li>Spectators
            will be able to watch the elite cycling action along the route and also at the
            official Tour de France fan parks sites. The fan park sites will feature a wide
            range of different activities such as live Tour de France racing on the big
            screen, a French-style food market, a Tour de France Museum, interactive
            cycling activities, an outdoor cinema, live music, celebrity appearances and
            shops showcasing all of the latest bike equipment and accessories. Team London
            volunteers will also be on hand at all of the fan park sites to help spectators
            with local travel information and directions. Tube and rail services will be
            the best way to get around affected areas of London on the day, although
            stations along and around the route, particularly the finish at the Mall, are
            expected to be extremely busy</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France will kick off a spectacular summer of cycling in London, with
            the exciting event followed by Prudential RideLondon on the 9 and 10 August and
            then the Tour of Britain, which traditionally finishes in the capital, taking
            place between 7 and 14 September.

            &middot; </li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France is the world's largest annual sporting event and covers
            approximately 3,500kms. A worldwide television audience of 3.5billion people
            watch the event annually. There will be 190 countries broadcasting the Tour de
            France and there are 5,000 hours of TV coverage annually. The last time the
            Tour visited England was in 2007 when London hosted the Grand D&eacute;part,
            which is the opening of the race</li>
            <li>This
            summer's cycling windfall is likely to inspire thousands more Londoners to take
            to two wheels, building on the Mayor's ambition for cycling to be an integral
            part of the transport network. As part of his cycling vision, the Mayor is
            already engaging in a vast &pound;1billion programme of improvements&nbsp; - creating
            a series of enhanced cycling superhighways, urban 'quietways' for more cautious
            cyclists, and turning some outer boroughs into mini-Hollands</li>
