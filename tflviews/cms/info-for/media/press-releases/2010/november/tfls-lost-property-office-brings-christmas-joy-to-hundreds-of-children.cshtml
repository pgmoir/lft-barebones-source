            <p>Transport for London's (TfL's) Lost Property Office is donating hundreds of brand new toys to The Salvation Army to give to disadvantaged children in south London over the Christmas period.</p>
<p>The toys will appeal to children of all ages and range from soft toys and board games to sports equipment.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Salvation Army in Deptford, south London, will work with the local council to distribute the toys to families in need.</p>
<p>Marilyn Voase, Property Section Manager at the Lost Property Office, said: 'TfL's Lost Property Office has been donating unclaimed toys to the Salvation Army for underprivileged children in London for four years now. </p>
<p>'We donate the toys to help children have a present at Christmas who otherwise would not get one. </p>
<p>'The idea came from a member of staff, Paul Farmer, and was supported by the rest of the staff who thought it would be nice to save up the unclaimed toys that are lost on the Tube, buses and black taxis and to donate them to this good cause.'</p>

<h2>A real difference</h2>
<p>Captain Kevin Stanbury of The Salvation Army's Deptford Community Centre, said: 'The Salvation Army is really grateful for Transport for London's support over the years. </p>
<p>'The presents make a real difference to people who would otherwise be struggling at this time of year.</p>
<p>'It's great to see the children's faces light up when they get the presents. </p>
<p>'Transport for London's donation really does bring joy to so many people.'</p>
<p>Around 1,000 items are handed in each day to the Lost Property Office. </p>
<p>Over the years people have handed in many unexpected and unusual items including, Rolex watches worth more than quarter of a million pounds, &pound;10,000 cash, human skulls, breast implants and a lawnmower.</p>
<p>Currently&nbsp;four&nbsp;in 10 bags, mobile phones and valuables are successfully reunited with their owners.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Unfortunately, a large number of people do not get in touch to enquire about their lost property meaning it can never be returned.
