        The Piccadilly line between Acton Town and Rayners Lane is likely to remain suspended this evening and tomorrow (Wednesday) at the request of the London Fire Brigade (LFB) and the Metropolitan Police.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Piccadilly line passengers in West London are advised to find alternative routes and allow more time for their journeys but to check travel bulletins and TfL travel information before setting out tomorrow at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/">www.tfl.gov.uk</a> or phone 020 7222 1234.</p>
<p>The part suspension of the Piccadilly line is due to a fire on Monday night involving gas cylinders at a chemical plant in the Alperton area.</p>
<p>A rail replacement bus service is in operation between Acton Town and Rayners Lane, calling at all intermediate stations except Park Royal, but will call at nearby Hanger Lane for Central line services.  </p>
<p>Valid London Underground (LU) tickets are being accepted for all local bus routes and on Chiltern Railways between West Ruislip and London Marylebone. </p>
<p>Some Chiltern services will make extra stops at Sudbury Hill Harrow and Sudbury & Harrow Road. <br><br>Car and bus journeys are also disrupted with Ealing Road closed and bus routes 83 and 487 on local diversion.</p>
<p>LU hopes to resume the service as soon as possible, depending on the advice received from the LFB.<br></p>
