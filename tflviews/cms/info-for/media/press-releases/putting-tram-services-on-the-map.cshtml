        New Tube map in stations from June 2016
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<ul>
    <li>Future versions to include the Elizabeth line and extensions of the Northern and Metropolitan lines</li>
</ul>
<p>Transport for London (TfL)'s latest Tube map is to include the Capital's tram services for the first time. The addition is designed to make it easier for those travelling to Wimbledon, Croydon or Beckenham to plan their journeys.</p>
<p>London Trams has recently seen a number of improvements, including an increase in services by 50 per cent between Wimbledon and Croydon after an additional platform at Wimbledon was completed last year. Four additional trams were also introduced in February, increasing the total number operating across the network to 34, and service information has been added to the electronic service update boards at TfL stations across London.</p>
<p>The new map also illustrates where and when major upgrade works will take place on the London Overground route between Gospel Oak and Barking, as part of Network Rail's Railway Upgrade Plan.</p>
<p>The latest stations with step-free access have been added to the map, as part of TfL's wider accessibility work. South Tottenham on the London Overground was the latest station to be made step-free and is now shown as step-free from street to platform. In the coming months, work at Vauxhall, Tottenham Court Road and Tower Hill will also be completed and added to the map &#45; increasing the number of London Underground stations which are step-free to more than 70. The Tram and DLR networks are also both completely step-free.</p>
<p>As London's transport network continues to expand to cope with the rapidly growing population, the map will be updated to show the new Elizabeth line when it starts running through central London from December 2018, as well as planned extensions to the Northern and Metropolitan lines from 2020.</p>
<p>Customers will begin to see the latest Tube map in stations throughout the next week, and it will be available to view online, along with other transport maps produced by TfL, at www.tfl.gov.uk/maps from 3 June 2016.</p>

<p>Notes to Editors:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A PDF of the June 2016 Tube Map is available from the TfL Press Office</li>
    <li>Now recognised across the world, the Tube map was originally the brainchild of Underground electrical draughtsman, Harry Beck, who produced this imaginative and beautifully simple design back in 1933 - <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/culture-and-heritage/art-and-design/harry-becks-tube-map">https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/culture-and-heritage/art-and-design/harry-becks-tube-map</a></li>
    <li>The Tube map was voted as one of London's top three 'Design Icons' by the public last year. Design Icons search is part of 'Transported by Design', an 18-month programme of events, exhibitions and competitions which celebrate the role of good design on London's transport network &#45; <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/transported-by-design">https://tfl.gov.uk/campaign/transported-by-design</a></li>
    <li>The London Tram network has experienced rapid growth in passenger numbers since it opened in 2000, from 18.5 million passengers in its first year of operation to over 32 million in 2014/15, and demand is forecast to increase to around 60 million by 2030. More frequent and faster journeys for customers have also been delivered between Mitcham Junction and Beddington Lane by adding new track to allow trams to travel in both directions simultaneously.</li>
    <li>Last month, live travel data for trams, providing up-to-the-minute information about when services will arrive were also added to TfL's freely available open-data feed for developers &#45; <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/developers">www.tfl.gov.uk/developers</a></li>
    <li>Earlier this month, the Mayor announced that the one hour &quot;Hopper&quot; fare will be introduced this September. The Hopper fare will automatically apply to anyone who uses 'pay as you go' on Oyster cards or contactless payment cards to make an additional bus or tram journey for free within one hour of when they first touched in.  For the vast majority of customers, this will mean an end to having to pay two fares when changing routes within an hour.</li>
