            <li>Part of TfL's radical new plan to generate more non fare revenue to reinvest in improving London's transport</li>
            <li>Public exhibition on proposals for the redevelopment, Tuesday 16 &#45; Friday 19 September , St James's Park station</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Transport for London (TfL) has today unveiled ambitious plans for the redevelopment of London Underground's historic home &#45; the Grade 1 listed 55 Broadway.</p>
        <p>The plans propose to transform the iconic building in Westminster from outdated offices to a landmark residential development with adjoining affordable and social housing and improved retail units. The project is part of TfL's radical new plans to generate more non-fare revenue - around &pound;3.5bn - which will all be reinvested into improving London's transport network - TfL will not 'retain' any of it.</p>
        <p>Detailed analysis conducted earlier this year identified that a residential led development of 55 Broadway would be the most suitable option to deliver best value for fare and taxpayers and would maintain the heritage of the building, enabling many of its original features to be retained. TfL has delivered a substantial on-site affordable housing provision with 22 per cent of homes affordable, including a number of high quality three bed duplex flats for social housing for families.</p>
        <p>Recognising the building's architectural significance, TfL is now leading the work to prepare a planning application for submission next month. Throughout the process TfL has engaged English Heritage to ensure the proposals preserve the building's iconic status.</p>
        <p>Graeme Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said: </p>
        <p>'Our aim is to make life in London better and help keep the city working and growing. This means recognising our role as the custodian of one of London's largest and most valuable property portfolios and developing our assets for the benefit of the city.&quot;All revenue raised from the redevelopment of 55 Broadway and the rest of our commercial activities will be reinvested, enabling us to make journeys better for everyone who uses public transport and the road network, bear down on the fares and charges people are asked to pay, and support economic prosperity in London and the UK.'</p>
        <p>Andrew Tate, Director of TateHindle, the architect firm who has prepared the planning proposals said: </p>
        <p>'We were excited to have the opportunity of working on Holden's visionary building. The most important interventions happen at ground level and will re-establish Holden's direct route from Victoria Street through to the St James's Park ticket hall, with a resulting increase in amount and quality of the retail space. Removing the 1970s Petty France building will provide a new entrance court creating a natural separation of the residential from the station and retail elements.</p>
        <p>'Public realm improvements will greatly enhance the setting of the Grade I listed building, wider, more generous stone paving and swapping the glass from opaque to clear will transform and open up the retail. The restoring of 55 Broadway's striking footprint will also allow views of two of the 'Winds' series of sculptures, that help make the building so memorable.'</p>
        <p>With a 5,700 acre property portfolio, TfL is the custodian of one of the largest and most valuable estates in London. TfL is committed to managing and developing this portfolio as part of bearing down on fares while continuing to modernise public transport and the capital's roads.</p>
        <p>Creative and innovative steps are being taken to use the five parts of TfL's commercial estate - stations, property, advertising, sponsorship and retail &#45; in order to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make journeys better for everyone who uses public transport and the road network</li>
            <li>Bear down on the fares and charges people are asked to pay</li>
            <li>Enable the city to grow and develop in a way sensitive to its rich heritage</li>
            <li>Build the economic prosperity of London and the UK through supporting growth and jobs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Early next year, TfL will be launching a process to identify a mix of private sector development partners, with whom it will be working over the next decade to transform TfL's huge property portfolio. The property that could be unlocked through this could make a real contribution towards London's rapidly growing population, providing vital new housing for Londoners, new office space, retail opportunities and more, while also generating vital income for TfL over the long-term of the investment. An exhibition on the proposals for the redevelopment of 55 Broadway is open to the public from Tuesday 16 September to Friday 19 September from 11:30-19:00 in retail units14-17 inside St James's Park station.&nbsp;The building, designed by Charles Holden between 1927 and 1929, was constructed as a new headquarters for the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL), the main forerunner of London Underground.</p>

            <li>The appointment of TateHindle follows a Competitive Dialogue Procurement Process under OJEU (Official Journal of European Union).</li>
            <li>London Underground owns the freehold interest in 55 Broadway, 100 Petty France and the Wing over Station (&quot;the Buildings&quot;) and holds a long occupational lease of Albany House. 55 Broadway is a Grade I Listed Building which lies within the Broadway &amp; Christchurch Gardens Conservation Area.</li>
            <li>The building was commissioned in the 1920s by The Underground Group who wanted Broadway to reflect its bold vision of the future of transport in London. Architects Adams, Holden and Pearson were given the task of creating a groundbreaking design.•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The site at St James's Park Tube station was challenging because of its irregular shape and the District and Circle line only 7.3 metres below. The solution was a cross-shaped layout, allowing pedestrians to walk through the ground floor of the offices, across the station booking hall, providing a short cut between Victoria Street and St James's Park.</li>
            <li>Above ground, the building was faced with 78,000 cubic feet of high quality Portland stone. Contemporary artists were invited to sculpt decorative features into the stone facade, carved on site. Two are just above street level and a further eight are above the sixth floor windows on each side of all four wings. The sculptors were:</li>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Jacob Epstein</li>
            <li>Eric Gill;</li>
            <li>Henry Moore;</li>
            <li>A H Garrard;</li>
            <li>Eric Automer;</li>
            <li>Allan Wyon; and</li>
            <li>F Rabinovitch.</li>
        </ol>
        <ul>
            <li>The Royal Institute of British Architects awarded 55 Broadway its 1929 London Architectural Medal.</li>
            <li>During WW2 the west wing received considerable damage as a result of bombing. It was rebuilt - without Portland stone facing which was not available at the time. The Portland stone was reinstated in 1963.</li>
            <li>55 Broadway was refurbished in the 1980s. The exterior stone work was cleaned, the windows replaced with exact replicas, and a new street-level shopping mall allowed the reopening of the eastern entrance to the building.</li>
        </ul>
