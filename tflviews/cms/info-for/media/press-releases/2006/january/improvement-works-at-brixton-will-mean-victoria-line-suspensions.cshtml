            <p>The works, undertaken by Metronet Rail BCV, the company responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the Victoria, Central, Bakerloo and Waterloo & City lines, will permit the installation of cables from platform switch rooms to the station operations room.</p>
<p>"John Doyle, General Manager of the Victoria line, said: "There is no safety risk to our customers or staff as the asbestos has not been disturbed and in that state it is safe. Air quality is being continually monitored by our asbestos control unit.</p>
<p>"Temporarily closing the station during the Easter period, when demand is reduced, is the best solution we can adopt to minimise disruption to our customers."</p>
<p>Victoria line trains will terminate at Stockwell during this period.</p>
<p>A high-frequency rail-replacement bus service will operate between Stockwell and Brixton during the closure period. </p>
<p>LU tickets will be accepted on all local bus services, including those connecting with local Network Rail stations.</p>
<p>LU customers may also wish to walk between Stockwell and Brixton, which takes 15-20 minutes.</p>
