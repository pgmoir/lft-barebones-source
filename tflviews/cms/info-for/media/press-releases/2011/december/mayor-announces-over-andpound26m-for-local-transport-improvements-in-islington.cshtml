                            Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.

            <p>The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking. </p>
<p>The &pound;2.6m funding package in 2012/13 will finance a range of transport projects in Islington, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;571,000 towards the second phase of a three year programme to regenerate Hornsey Road and improve the safety for cyclists and pedestrians. Particular attention will be made to improving access to local shops and reducing accidents </li>
<li>&pound;100,000 towards the second phase of a &pound;1.1m three-year regeneration of the Archway area.&nbsp;Works include the creation of an open space at Archway Close and works to progress the removal of the one way system that severs the town centre</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'London is undergoing a neo-Victorian level of investment in its transport network.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.</p>
<p>'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'</p>
<h2>Working in partnership</h2>
<p>The LIP funds hundreds of large and small scale transport projects every year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year in Islington it financed 72 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 2,086 children and 559 adults; 63 road safety education and training events, 12 new accessible bus stops, 25 cycling events, 2 new on-street electric vehicle charging points and 38 new street trees.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.</p>
<p>'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'</p>
<p>The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14. </p>

<li>Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp;While TfL allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough </li>
<li>A detailed breakdown of funding for bridge strengthening projects (&pound;5.3m), which will be allocated to the bridges in most need of work will be announced in the New Year </li>
