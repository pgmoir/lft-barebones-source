            <p>The Mayor of London today confirmed &pound;4.9m for Enfield to spend on local transport improvements during 2010/11, including &pound;774,000 for essential road maintenance and &pound;288,000 for major schemes.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Enfield has been developing proposals for a number of schemes that it will be financing with the funding package, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;750,000 for Greenway routes across the borough that will connect parks and green areas as well as low traffic areas, encouraging cycling and walking </li>
<li>&pound;80,000 to implement measures for a lorry ban between the A406 and Haringey borough boundary </li>
<li>&pound;30,000 to hold road safety theatres in education projects in schools to increase road safety awareness among children and reduce road traffic casualties </li>
<li>&pound;30,000 to implement road safety measures to address problems caused by through traffic on the A10 service road (Hoe Lane to Severn Drive) </li>
<li>&pound;288,000 for the design of improvements to safety, security and pedestrian access around Lytchett Way including through better paving and lighting</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'Even in these tough economic times I am committed to providing this funding to all of London's boroughs.</p>
<p>'The investment means that across the Capital, town centres and public spaces are being overhauled, cycling and walking facilities are being improved, and roads are being made safer. </p>
<p>'We have cut red tape to make it easier for borough councils to choose the local transport projects that benefit their residents the most, simplifying the funding system and working together to give local people the improvements they want. </p>
<h2>Fairer funding formulas</h2>
<p>'This time we're also giving an extra focus to cycling - helping to provide the training, cycle parking, and maintenance knowhow to support the introduction of the first two Cycle Superhighways next year.'</p>
<p>Funding for local schemes is allocated each year by Transport for London (TfL).</p>
<p>The Mayor has simplified the system - reducing the number of funding streams from 23 to five, and introducing fairer funding formulas where needed.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Enfield has identified a range of small and large scale projects that will make a real difference to local people by improving town centres and public spaces, reducing the number of collisions on our roads, improving the environment and promoting greener forms of travel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Enfield also has the flexibility to move certain funding between projects if, during the course of the year, they find more or less funding is needed for individual schemes.'</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong> </p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally </li>
<li>While TfL allocated funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough </li>
<li>In addition to the usual borough allocation, TfL has included &pound;100,000 for each of the boroughs to spend locally on transport as they choose </li>
<li>Below is a table with a breakdown of LIP funding for Enfield:</li></ul>
