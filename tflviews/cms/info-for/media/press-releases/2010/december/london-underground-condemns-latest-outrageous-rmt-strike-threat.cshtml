            <p>Extremely low turnout in Bakerloo ballot over driver disciplined for safety breach.</p>
<p>London Underground (LU) today condemned the RMT leadership for threatening strike action in defence of two drivers, one of whom has been dismissed for a serious safety breach and the other who faces disciplinary action over alleged abusive behaviour towards colleagues.</p>
<p>The ballots closed earlier this week with Northern line staff flatly rejecting the strike call. </p>
<p>Of the 192 staff balloted over the driver's dismissal, just 80 took part in the vote, with only 38 voting for strike action - less than 20 per cent. </p>
<p>However, the RMT leadership has today announced they still intend to try to disrupt Londoners on one of the busiest shopping days of the year.</p>
<p>In the Bakerloo line ballot, just 42 people voted for strike action out of a total of 119 balloted - just a third of the total members. </p>
<p>The Bakerloo line driver's case has been considered on appeal by LU, and his dismissal confirmed. </p>
<p>The Northern line driver has not been dismissed, yet the union has already called for strike action.</p>
<p>Howard Collins, LU's chief operating officer, said: 'The RMT leadership has utterly failed in its attempt to gain support from staff on the Northern line for a driver being dealt with over allegations of totally unacceptable and abusive behaviour towards colleagues.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Only 19 per cent of those balloted voted for strike action.&nbsp;It is also utterly outrageous for the RMT to threaten strike action in support of someone dismissed for a serious breach of safety rules on the Bakerloo line.</p>
<p>'The facts speak for themselves.&nbsp;Yet again, the RMT leadership shows utter contempt for Londoners and the integrity of their own strike ballot process. </p>
<p>'They should end these pointless strike threats and get on with working with us to deliver an upgraded Tube system for London.'</p>
<p>Despite having no mandate for strike action, the RMT leadership has instructed its Northern line drivers at the Morden depot to strike from 21:00 on Friday 17 December until 20:59 on Saturday 18 December 2010.</p>
<p>They have instructed Bakerloo line drivers to strike from 21:00&nbsp;on Friday 17 December until 20:59&nbsp;on Saturday 18 December 2010.</p>
<p>Despite this, LU fully intends to run services on these and all other lines and passengers will still be able to get around the city.</p>
