<p>The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced &pound;3.8m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Haringey to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to &pound;168.3m from &pound;161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.</p>
<p>TfL has included &pound;100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses.</p>
<p>The &pound;3.8m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>&pound;375,000 for the renewal of the carriageways and footways of West Green Road which are known to be currently in poor condition and will be renewed to correct any uneven surface, potholes and cracks. Pedestrians and vehicles will benefit from smooth, defect-free roads resulting in safer journeys in the borough </li>
<li>&pound;50,000 towards key walking routes at Wood Green High Road/Turnpike Lane station/St Anne's Hospital/Seven Sisters station.&nbsp;The improvements will mean better pedestrian access to several local amenities including leisure centres and schools.&nbsp;The scheme aims to encourage people to walk instead of taking short car trips </li>
<li>&pound;20,000 to help fund the installation of four Electrical Recharging Points in the borough. They will provide an alternative energy source which aims to improve local air quality for businesses, residents, visitors and fleet operators by assisting in reducing CO2 emissions </li>
<li>&pound;80,000 for cycle training and a bike doctor maintenance programme.</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'When I was elected I promised I would be different and give greater freedom to the Boroughs.</p>
<p>'This is why this year I have introduced a &pound;100,000 award for Boroughs to spend as they choose.</p>
<p>'Boroughs are being given greater freedom to develop and deliver the schemes they want, which means more choice over a range of key local schemes to improve town centres and cycling facilities, tackle the school run and improve local roads.<br>&nbsp;<br>'I am awarding Haringey a budget of &pound;3.8m next year for local schemes that will make travelling safer, more accessible and more environment-friendly, helping to improve the quality of life for people across the borough.'</p>
<p>Funding for local transport schemes is allocated each year by TfL in response to the applications from boroughs based on their Local Implementation [transport] Plans (LIPs).</p>
<p>Funding is currently available for a wide range of programmes including road safety, maintaining borough roads, tackling the school run, improving walking, cycling and the local environment, making transport more accessible and measures to improve bus journeys.</p>
