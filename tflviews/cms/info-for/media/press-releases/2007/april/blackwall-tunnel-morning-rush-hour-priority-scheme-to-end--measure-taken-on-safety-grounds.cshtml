            <p>
<p>Tidal flow is the term used to describe traffic operating in opposite directions in the southbound tunnel in morning rush hours. </p>
<p>The system has been used since 1978 to cope with the demand of northbound traffic across the Thames.</p>
<p>But an increase in dangerous driving behaviour, including overtaking in the tunnel, has led the Metropolitan Police and Transport for London to bring an end to this system, from Friday 20 April 2007. </p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police will review its operation each morning for the remainder of this week.</p>
<p>TfL is committed to increasing safety in the tunnel and has recently carried out maintenance work improving fireproofing and radio communications. </p>
<p>TfL anticipates there will be some increase in congestion on the south approach to the tunnel as a result of this decision. </p>
<h2>Monitoring traffic</h2>
<p>Changes in traffic flows will be monitored and congestion mitigated wherever possible.</p>
<p>David Brown, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: 'The safe and efficient operation of traffic through the Blackwall Tunnel is our primary concern.</p>
<p>'The increasing number of 'near misses' in this enclosed environment poses a significant safety risk and endangers lives. </p>
<p>'This decision has been taken jointly with the Metropolitan Police and is aimed at delivering the highest possible safety standards to London's motorists.' </p>
<h2>Working together</h2>
<p>Detective Superintendent Glyn Jones from the Metropolitan Police Service's Traffic Command Unit said: 'The Metropolitan Police Service is committed to working together with partners to make London the safest city in the world.</p>
<p>'This applies not only to issues connected with the fear of crime but equally to the safety of roads users. </p>
<p>'We have a continuing commitment to reducing injuries and fatalities due to road traffic collisions.</p>
<p>'Our monitoring of the behaviour of tunnel traffic has led us to the conclusion, agreed with TfL, that the tidal flow should cease.' </p>
<h2>Maintenance programme</h2>

<p>Essential routine maintenance work will continue to be carried out on the northbound tunnel.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This will require some contraflow arrangements, where traffic operates in two directions, in the southbound tunnel overnight on Tuesdays during low traffic volume periods. </p>
<p>This forms part of the maintenance programme that has also included refurbishment of the southbound tunnel, which was completed in December 2005. <br></p>
