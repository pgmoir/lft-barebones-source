<h2>Pension increases</h2>
<p>While you are below State Pension Age, the whole of your pension will increase each April.</p>
<p>It is increased in line with the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation over the 12 months ending in the previous September. If you joined after 1 April 1989, your increases are limited to a maximum of 5 per cent.</p>
<p>The annual RPI increase under the Fund cannot fall below zero. The pension increase will be determined over the relevant 12 months. If there is no increase in the RPI, your pension will remain unchanged for that year.</p>
<p>Pension increases are paid in the first pension payment of each tax year. Unfortunately, we can't pay increases sooner as the process can only start at the end of the previous tax year.</p>
<h3>Increases at State Pension Age</h3>
<p>Once you reach State Pension Age, increases will be paid on the various parts of your pension as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Pension in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension (GMP) (including all pension earned after 5 April 1997)</strong><br />
This part of your pension is increased as described above.</p>
<p><strong>GMP earned between 6 April 1988 and 5 April 1997</strong><br />
This part of your pension is also increased as above, up to a maximum of 3 per cent each year.</p>
<p> Further increases may be paid by the State.</p>
<p><strong>GMP earned before 6 April 1988</strong><br />
This part of your pension is not increased by the Fund but may be increased by the State.</p>
<h3>Adult dependant and children's pension increases</h3>
<p>Pensions payable to your adult dependant and eligible children are increased each year in the same way as your pension.</p>
<p>We will continue to pay increases to your pension wherever you live. In addition, if you live in a country in the European Economic Area (EEA) or a country which has a social security agreement with the UK, you will also receive increases on your basic state pension and possibly your GMP from the UK Government.</p>
<p> The countries involved change from time to time as determined by the UK Government. Details can be found on the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions">Department for Work and Pensions' website</a>.</p>
<h2>Missing pension payments</h2>
<p>If you think that you have not received a pension payment you should first check with your bank. If your bank is unable to locate your payment please <a href="/pensions/contact">contact the Fund Office</a> immediately.</p>
<h2>Living overseas</h2>
<p>If you live abroad your benefits can either be paid to a bank account in the UK or direct into an overseas bank account via Western Union. For overseas payments it is important that the information provided is complete and accurate and that all of the information requested on the payment manadate is provided in full, otherwise this may lead to delays in the payment reaching your account.</p>

<h2>Changing address or bank</h2>
<p>You can advise the Fund Office of a change of address using <a href="/corporate/careers/member-self-service">Member Self Service</a>, by completing the relevant <a href="/corporate/careers/forms">form</a>, or by letter or telephone.</p>
<p>Changes of bank must be made in writing or by completing the relevant <a href="/corporate/careers/forms">form</a>. Please note that your pension can only be paid into an account in your name. Change of bank account details should be provided at least 15 working days before your next payment is due.</p>
<p>Please note that due to the large volume of changes received, only changes to bank accounts are acknowledged.</p>

<p>A P60 will be included in your annual payslip to help with your tax return.</p>
