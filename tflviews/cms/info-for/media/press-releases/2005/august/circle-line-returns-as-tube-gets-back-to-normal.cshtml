            <p>Since 7 July, the Circle line has been suspended in its entirety.</p>
<p>However, because all the services have been restored to the affected stretches of the District, Hammersmith &amp; City and Metropolitan lines, all Circle line stations are presently being served, even when the Circle line is not running.</p>
<p>Restoring Tube services to all lines and stations within the space of four weeks is a tremendous achievement and one that has been made possible by the incredible efforts from LU, Metronet and Tube Lines staff.</p>
