<p>Spectators of the Torch Relay<br>If you are using the District Line to reach the Torch route, please allow plenty of time for your journey.<br>TfL's key travel advice for tomorrow (Sunday, 22 July):</p>
<ul>
<li>Experience from around the UK shows that very large and enthusiastic crowds will welcome the Torch as it travels through the capital; </li>
<li>If you are planning to view the Torch, stay local - the Torch is passing through every London borough so try to view it when it passes through an area close to your home or work; </li>
<li>Avoid driving on, or close to, roads that the Torch Relay will be visiting, as well as central London, around the ORN and venues; </li>
<li>If you have to drive, plan ahead, consider re-timing your journey and allow more time; </li>
<li>Works started on the night of Friday 20 July on the final stage of physical works necessary to ensure the Olympic Route Network (ORN) is ready to begin operation on Wednesday 25 July; </li>
<li>On public transport, avoid stations that are on or close to the Torch Relay routes.&nbsp; These stations will be exceptionally busy up to two hours before and at least one hour after the Torch passes; </li>
<li>Cultural events are taking place across London today, see <a href="http://www.molpresents.com">http://www.molpresents.com</a> for further information. If possible, avoid these areas if you are not attending an event. </li>
