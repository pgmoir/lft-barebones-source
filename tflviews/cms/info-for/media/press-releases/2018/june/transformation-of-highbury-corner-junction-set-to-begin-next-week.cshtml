<p>Construction work to improve a junction with one of the poorest safety records in London will begin on the 28 June, Transport for London (TfL), the Mayor of London and Islington Council have announced.</p>
<p>The transformation of Highbury Corner will see the intimidating 1960s roundabout removed and replaced with two-way roads, with the installation of segregated cycle lanes on all three remaining sides of the roundabout. There will also be a new public space created for residents and visitors to enjoy. The improvements to the junction will improve safety for cyclists, pedestrians and all other road users.</p>
<p>The work at Highbury Corner is set to continue until late 2019 and TfL is advising residents to plan ahead and leave more time for journeys while the work is taking place. Full travel advice and information is available on the TfL website at <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/highbury-corner">tfl.gov.uk/highbury-corner</a></p>
<p>The improvements to Highbury Corner include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Closing the western arm of the roundabout to create a public space, including the Highbury &amp; Islington station forecourt and part of the arboretum (the green space at the centre of the roundabout);</li>
    <li>Installing segregated cycle lanes on all three remaining sides of the roundabout;</li>
    <li>Introducing two-way traffic;</li>
    <li>Encouraging more walking with wider and 'straight across' (replacing existing two-stage) pedestrian crossings - making it easier to cross and new Legible London signage to improve wayfinding;</li>
    <li>Providing local residents and visitors with more green space by partially opening the arboretum to public access, while protecting the most sensitive parts;</li>
    <li>Closing the southern section of Corsica Street to motor traffic and creating a continuous footway across the junction entrance to give pedestrians priority over traffic;</li>
    <li>Installing a shared pedestrian/cycle toucan crossing across St Paul's Road to allow two-way cycling to and from Corsica Street.</li>
</ul>
<p>The work at the roundabout will coincide with essential gas works taking place to help reduce further road closures and TfL is working closely with Cadent Gas to minimise disruption to local residents and businesses.</p>
<p>To help the new road layout to operate more effectively, there will be changes to the route 277 bus. It will no longer terminate at Highbury Corner and the service will not run between Highbury Corner and Dalston Junction from Saturday 30 June. Passengers requiring services between Highbury Corner and Dalston can use the route 30 and additional buses will run on this route at peak times to ensure demand is met.</p>
<p><strong>Deputy Mayor for Transport, Heidi Alexander, said:</strong> `I'm delighted that work that is getting underway on these plans that will improve safety and improve the environment for everyone who uses Highbury Corner. With more segregated cycle lanes across the junction, improved pedestrian crossings, and a new public space the transformed junction will encourage even more people to walk and cycle as part of their everyday routine. The changes are a great example of a council working closely with TfL to improve quality of life for everyone.'</p>
<p><strong>Ben Plowden, TfL's Surface Transport Director of Strategy &amp; Network Development, said:</strong> `Once complete, one of London's most dangerous junctions will be transformed and will support the movement of more people by making walking, cycling and public transport easier and safer. The new junction layout will also safely open up a tranquil pocket of greenery in the middle of the city for all to enjoy.</p>
<p>`There will be some disruption while the work is taking place, so Londoners are advised to plan ahead and leave more time for their journeys after the work starts.'</p>
<p><strong>Cllr Claudia Webbe, Islington Council's Executive Member for Environment and Transport, said:</strong> `This very exciting project will transform a dangerous and outdated junction into a safer and much more attractive place for pedestrians, public transport users and cyclists, including safer segregated cycle lanes.</p>
<p>&quot;Highbury Corner will become a much-improved space for residents, business workers and visitors when the work is complete, with the station linked up to green space that is currently stranded on a traffic island, making it a much more welcoming and enjoyable place for people. We're very pleased work is about to begin and we will closely monitor its progress, and work closely with TfL to address any issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, TfL named Highbury Corner as one of the capital's worst junctions on its Safer Junctions list. Using casualty figures, 73 London junctions with the worst safety records were identified and are being improved to make them safer for all road users. The Highbury Corner improvements as part of this scheme will be monitored to ensure that casualty levels reduce and that lessons are learned to improve the future design and construction of projects.</p>
<p>The junction improvements are in line with TfL's Vision Zero ambition to create a road network free from death or serious injury by 2041. To achieve this goal, TfL is working with the police and London boroughs, developing a world leading bus safety standard for London, removing the most dangerous Heavy Goods Vehicles from London's roads and funding boroughs to create Liveable Neighbourhoods, which will transform neighbourhoods across the capital into greener, healthier, more attractive public spaces.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Kocharhook, Committee Member at Cycle Islington, said:</strong> `Many people on bicycles do their best to avoid Highbury Corner today. The new junction layout will be a huge improvement for adults and children of all ages. We are confident that these cycle tracks will be just as popular as others installed over the past five years in London. We can't wait to cycle on the new design as soon as it's finished!'</p>
<p><strong>David Harrison, Co-ordinator at Living Streets, said:</strong> `Highbury Corner is a hostile and intimidating place for pedestrians. I am very pleased that Islington Council and TfL are investing to improve the area for pedestrians and create a new open public space.'</p>
<ul>
    <li>Full travel advice is available at <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/highbury-corner">tfl.gov.uk/highbury-corner</a></li>
    <li>Route 277 daytime services will run between Leamouth and Dalston Junction bus station. The route will no longer serve stops on St Paul's Road and Balls Pond Road. The night time service will be renumbered N277 and extended via Upper Street, terminating in White Lion Street, serving additional stops in Pentonville Road, Baron Street and White Lion Street</li>
    <li>The consultation ran between 5 February and 20 March 2016 and received 2,823 responses. Overall, 71 per cent of respondent believed the proposals would improve conditions for pedestrians, 67 per cent believed the proposals would improve conditions for cyclists, and 59 per cent believed the proposals would improve conditions for Tube / rail passengers. TfL and Islington Council's responses to issues raised and the full breakdown of respondents can be found here, <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/highbury-corner-roundabout">tfl.gov.uk/highbury-corner-roundabout</a></li>
    <li>The most vulnerable trees will be protected, as changes to the access of the arboretum mean that the work to the eastern half of the arboretum, including the option to open up a path from the south-eastern corner, will not be carried forward</li>
    <li>More information on TfL's Safer Junctions list is available here: <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2017/april/new-roads-targeted-in-updated-safer-junctions-programme">tfl.gov.uk/info-for/media/press-releases/2017/april/new-roads-targeted-in-updated-safer-junctions-programme</a></li>
    <li>The latest cycling in London statistics can be found here -tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/travel-in-london-reports</li>
    <li>TfL and Islington will monitor the traffic impact on local surrounding roads and will consider any necessary mitigation measures</li>
