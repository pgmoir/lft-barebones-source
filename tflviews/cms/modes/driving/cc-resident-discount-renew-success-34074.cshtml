<p>We will consider your renewal once we have received all the documents to support it.</p>

<p>We will let you know the outcome by your preferred communication channel. If your discount is due to expire and has not been renewed by the expiry date, you will need to pay the charge from that date.</p>

<p>If your discount has already expired you will need to pay the charge until you receive confirmation that it has been successfully renewed.</p>
