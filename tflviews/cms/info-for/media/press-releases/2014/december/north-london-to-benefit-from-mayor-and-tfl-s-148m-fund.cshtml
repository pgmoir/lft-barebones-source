        North London boroughs set to benefit from the Mayor's and TfL's &pound;148m fund for local transport improvements in 2015/16
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Town centres across North London are set to be transformed after the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, today confirmed &pound;148m in funding for local transport and public realm projects in 2015/16. Local areas will see safer roads, better public spaces, improved walking facilities and cycling made safer and easier.</p>
<p>The annual funding has been allocated by TfL to each London borough to support the delivery of its Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.</p>
<p>In recognition of the importance of delivering road improvements in support of the Mayor's transport priorities, LIP investment levels of &pound;148m per year have been maintained for next year, despite a reduction in TfL's central Government funding.</p>
<p>LIP funding for 2015/16 will support a range of different transport initiatives across North London produced by the boroughs including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Barnet - &pound;259,000 for 20mph zones across streets close to schools, &pound;400,000 for cycle quietways and &pound;100,000 for additional electric vehicle charging points;</li>
    <li>Haringey - &pound;600,000 towards improving the public spaces around Green Lanes, which complements a major project to transform Wood Green which is due for completion in June 2015.  &pound;422,000 for new 20mph zones across the borough;</li>
    <li>Enfield - &pound;1.55m for a major project to enhance Ponders End and &pound;100,000 for improvements to Bush Hill and Turkey Street stations;</li>
    <li>Waltham Forest - &pound;55,000 to help launch a &pound;2.2m project to improve the junction between Blackhorse Road and Forest Road.  &pound;400,000 towards borough wide 20mph zones for residential streets;</li>
    <li>Camden - &pound;70,000 towards transforming the public realm of Kilburn including making improvements to the A5 corridor to enhance road safety, pedestrian accessibility and regenerate the High Street;</li>
    <li>Islington - &pound;80,000 towards improving Archway public realm around St Johns Grove in support of plans to remove the Archway Gyratory.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: `This funding is specifically targeted to provide benefits at key locations across London, helping to make the capital's roads and open spaces safer, more pleasant places to be. Providing better cycling and walking routes, as well as a raft of major improvements to our streets will help to boost the quality of life of those who live and work in our great city. By working with the boroughs to deliver better transport in their areas, we can in turn help to support jobs and economic growth in the capital as a whole.'</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Sir Peter Hendy CBE, said: `This funding will help continue to deliver real improvements to communities in North London. We are working in partnership with North London boroughs to deliver hundreds of transport projects that will benefit local communities and all road users whether they are pedestrians, cyclists or drivers. Public squares and shopping areas will also be rejuvenated, attracting more people to those areas and boosting the local economy.'</p>
<p>In addition to ensuring the boroughs have the necessary funding to improve the quality of their local roads TfL is also working with them to help improve efficiency, add value for money and keep the disruption of road and construction works to a minimum. For example, London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) help the boroughs avoid individually appointing contractors to undertake works. These are four area-based joint highway contracts, helping to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>
TfL is also working in partnership with London Councils to identify any gaps in skills and resources, which could be filled through more collaborative working between boroughs and TfL, such as apprenticeships, mentoring and sharing resources.</p>
<p>Last year North London boroughs used TfL funding for their Local Implementation Plans to deliver a range of improvements for local communities through safer junctions, reduced traffic speeds and better walking routes.</p>
<p>Significant projects in North London awarded funding last year include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Haringey - &pound;3.7m to help transform Wood Green by June 2015 and &pound;150k towards improving the area around Green Lanes, which is also progressing well;</li>
    <li>Waltham Forest - &pound;1.5m towards a project to improve Walthamstow Town Centre, which will be completed in early 2015 and will also transform Hoe Street;</li>
    <li>Camden - &pound;500,000 towards road safety improvements in high priority areas where speed has been identified as a problem, despite 20mph zones.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<ul>
    <li>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.  While Transport for London allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough.</li>
