        As the first phase of opening the Vauxhall Cross interchange, bus passengers will be able to use the new bus station later this year.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Work has been ongoing for two years to build the interchange in one of the busiest parts of central London. Every day 65,000 vehicles, 2,000 buses on 13 routes, 712 Undergound trains, 730 overground trains, and 45,000 commuters travel through Vauxhall Cross. The bus stops are being moved into the interchange early to keep roads clear for the start of the new school year when traffic levels are higher. The interchange will be fully finished at the beginning of October.</p>
<p>The new interchange will provide easier access to, and transfer between, bus, Tube and rail services, including a staircase leading directly into the Tube station, pedestrian crossings, and walkways. It will be able to handle expected improvements to bus services from developments in the Vauxhall Cross area. There is also greater provision for cyclists and the improved road layout, coupled with the 13 bus routes being taken away from the gyratory system into the interchange, will make it easier for traffic to negotiate one of London's busiest junctions.</p>
<p>Managing Director of Surface Transport at Transport for London, Peter Hendy, says;<br>&quot;The Vauxhall Cross interchange has been an ambitious project for TfL. For passengers at Vauxhall Cross, changing between bus, rail and Tube had been difficult for a long time. At the same time, pedestrians and cyclists had to use a road network dominated by cars and lorries. We've tackled these issues head on and passengers and residents will have a transport interchange that will improve their journeys and make them feel safer.&quot; </p>
<p>The 200 metre structure forming the central bus station uses cutting edge design to deliver modern needs, and make Vauxhall one of the most high-tech interchanges in the world. The two cantilevered arms ('forks') at the front are covered in 168 of the most technologically advanced solar panels, enabling the interchange to produce a third of its own electricity, even selling back any off peak excess to the National Grid.</p>
            <ul>
<li>The Vauxhall Cross Interchange will be fully open to all other users this year. 
</li><li>The power generated by the solar panels will save enough to power eight three-bedroom houses for a year and in one year the electricity generated by this bus station will be enough to make nearly 1 million pieces of toast. 
</li><li>Transport for London worked in partnership with the Mayor of London, Cross River Partnership, London Development Agency, London Borough of Lambeth and others to improve public transport facilities at Vauxhall Cross. Designed to reflect the Mayor's integrated transport strategy, the interchange supports greater use of public transport, cycling and walking, while aiming to reduce accidents and congestion. 
<p>The main feature of the interchange is the fully pedestrianised bus station area. It brings bus stops from the major surrounding roads (South Lambeth Road, Wandsworth Road and the south end of Vauxhall Bridgefoot) to a central area along Bondway making it far more convenient and safer for passengers.</p>The main aims of the Vauxhall Cross Transport Interchange are: 
</li><li>improve traffic flows; 
</li><li>introduce more pedestrian crossings; 
</li><li>improve facilities for cyclists; 
</li><li>The interchange is the focal point of an extensive regeneration programme for the area, led by Lambeth Council working with Cross River Partnership to broker links into surrounding areas. This includes the transformation of the railway viaduct running through from Vauxhall to Bermondsey, a shadowy corridor which divides communities from neighbouring areas and from the riverside. It is traversed by a network of 97 road and pedestrian tunnels, and is one of central London's greatest regeneration challenges. Its &pound;20m restoration will encourage businesses to use arches next to the tunnels as premises, creating a new business corridor capable of accommodating 10,000 jobs. The restoration will also transform surrounding open spaces, making the viaduct an historical asset rather than a Victorian blight. Six parks and open spaces in and around Vauxhall are also being restored to make the most of the calm and space offered by theses pockets of green in an intensely build up area. </li></ul><strong>Revised bus routes and stops: </strong>
