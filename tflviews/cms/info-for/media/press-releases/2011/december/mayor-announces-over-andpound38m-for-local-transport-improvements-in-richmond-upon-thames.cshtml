                            Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.

            <p>The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking. </p>
<p>The &pound;3.8m funding package in 2012/13 will finance a range of transport projects in Richmond, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;1m to complete the Major Scheme of traffic and urban realm improvements around Richmond Town Centre. Works will include a new pedestrian only forecourt and a new crossing outside Richmond Station </li>
<li>&pound;330,000 to promote cycling in the borough. Measures will include improved cycle parking, cycle training and converting towpaths to create shared paths for cycling and walking </li>
<li>&pound;245,000 to implement a range of measures to promote walking, including access improvements at several road crossings and junctions</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'London is undergoing a neo-Victorian level of investment in its transport network.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.</p>
<p>'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'</p>
<p>The LIP funds hundreds of large and small scale transport projects every year.</p>
<p>Last year in Richmond it financed 1,350 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 2,576 children and168 adults, 27 schools to participate in walking events, 27 smarter driving events to help reduce CO2,12 new on-street car club bays and 800 new street trees. </p>
<h2>Working in partnership</h2>
<p>Notable larger projects undertaken in Richmond this year include station access improvements to Barnes Station which the LIP contributed &pound;350,000 of total &pound;850,000 cost.</p>

<p>The improvements have delivered two fully accessible bus stops with more space for safer and more convenient waiting environments.</p>

<p>A new pedestrian crossing facility has been installed to assist interchange at the station between trains and buses and to improve access to the surrounding area. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.</p>
<p>'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'</p>
<p>The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14. </p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp;While TfL allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough </li>
<li>A detailed breakdown of funding for bridge strengthening projects (&pound;5.3m), which will be allocated to the bridges in most need of work will be announced in the New Year </li>
<li>Total allocation by programme area:</li></ul>
