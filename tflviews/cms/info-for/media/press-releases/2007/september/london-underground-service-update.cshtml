<p>As a result of the RMT strike action at Metronet, there is no service on two thirds of the London Underground network. There is currently no service on the Central, Bakerloo, Victoria, Waterloo &amp; City, Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan and East London lines.</p>
<p>The RMT strike action commenced at 18:00 this evening, Monday 3 September and is due to run for 72hrs until 18:00 on Thursday 6 September. Should the strike run its full course, it will mean no service on the lines listed above on Tuesday 4, Wednesday 5 and Thursday 6 September.</p>
<p>Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly line services, which are maintained by Tube Lines, should continue to operate, although they are likely to be very busy in consequence.</p>
<p>Docklands Light Railway and London Buses will continue to operate as normal.&nbsp; Passengers are urged to be patient and to respect the efforts of all transport staff in London as they work to deliver transport services.</p>
