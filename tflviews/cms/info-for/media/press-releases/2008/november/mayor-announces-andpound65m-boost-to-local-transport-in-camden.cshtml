            <p>The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced &pound;6.5m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Camden to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to &pound;168.3m from &pound;161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.</p>
<p>TfL has included &pound;100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses.</p>
<p>The &pound;6.5m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;470,000 for the renewal of the carriageways and footways of the A502 Chalk Farm Road which are known to be currently in poor condition will be renewed to correct any uneven surface, potholes and cracks. Pedestrians and vehicles will benefit from smooth, defect-free roads resulting in safer journeys in the borough </li>
<li>&pound;620,000 for the Camden Town Centre scheme which will deliver widened footways, new crossing points and better lighting to make the area safer, more accessible and easier to use for pedestrians. Cycle and motorcycle parking facilities will also be installed </li>
<li>&pound;90,000 for a cycle station programme and &pound;70,000 in cycle training </li>
<li>&pound;60,000 to help fund the installation of seven electrical recharging points in the borough. They will provide an alternative energy source which aims to improve local air quality for businesses, residents, visitors and fleet operators by assisting in reducing CO2 emissions</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'When I was elected I promised I would be different and give greater freedom to the boroughs. </p>
<p>'This is why this year I have introduced a &pound;100,000 award for boroughs to spend as they choose. </p>
<p>'Boroughs are being given greater freedom to develop and deliver the schemes they want, which means more choice over a range of key local schemes to improve town centres and cycling facilities, tackle the school run and improve local roads.<br>&nbsp;<br>''I am awarding Camden a budget of &pound;6.5m next year for local schemes that will make travelling safer, more accessible and more environment-friendly, helping to improve the quality of life for people across the borough.'</p>
<p>Funding for local transport schemes is allocated each year by TfL in response to the applications from boroughs based on their Local Implementation [transport] Plans (LIPs). </p>
<p>Funding is currently available for a wide range of programmes including road safety, maintaining borough roads, tackling the school run, improving walking, cycling and the local environment, making transport more accessible and measures to improve bus journeys.&nbsp; </p>
