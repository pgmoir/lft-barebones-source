                            These additional cameras are aimed at the minority of drivers on London's roads who think they can break the law and get away with it

            <p>The forward facing cameras will be installed at two speed camera sites in central London to support existing rear facing speed cameras. </p>
<p>The trial cameras will take a digital image of the front of speeding cars at the same time as a traditional speed camera takes an image from the rear. </p>
<p>This will enable the police to positively identify speeding motorists.</p>
<p>Some people caught speeding attempt to avoid penalty points on their licence and a fine by claiming not to have been driving the vehicle when it was photographed.</p>
<p>Speed cameras play an important role in reducing the number of people killed or seriously injured on the capital's roads. </p>
<p>At camera sites introduced by the London Safety Camera Partnership (LSCP) there has been an average 50 per cent reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured.</p>
<p>In July 2006 LSCP introduced speed awareness workshops for motorists caught speeding and a set amount over the speed limit. </p>
<p>Some motorists are offered the opportunity to attend a workshop instead of receiving three penalty points. </p>
<p>Jenny Jones, the Mayor of London's road safety ambassador, said: "These additional cameras are aimed at the minority of drivers on London's roads who think they can break the law and get away with it. </p>
<p>"We are determined to close the legal loopholes, catch the rogue drivers who put others at risk and have a consistent approach to traffic law enforcement in London." </p>
<p>Chris Lines, Head of the London Road Safety Unit, Transport for London, said: 'Some motorists believe they are above the law and should be able to speed without facing the legal consequences. </p>
<p>"Speed is a contributory factor in a third of fatalities in London and we hope trialling these cameras will enable us to stop motorists who endanger lives by speeding. </p>
<p>"We have proven in London that speed cameras do cut death and injury on the roads. Our new speed awareness workshops reinforce the message that speed cameras are about saving lives."</p>
<p>LSCP will trial the front facing cameras at two sites on Upper Thames Street in Central London. </p>
<p>The cameras, which are due to be installed in the next few weeks, will be used to provide supporting evidence for offences at these sites. </p>
<p>If the trial is successful LSCP will consider installing further cameras at sites where a problem has been identified.<br></p>
