        <p>They become the seventh and eighth bus routes
        in the capital to operate with the world's greenest diesel electric hybrid
        buses
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        From today (Wednesday 2 July)
        routes 8 and 38 have become the latest in the capital to be served entirely by
        New Routemasters. </p>
        <p>They are the cleanest and greenest diesel electric hybrid
        double deck buses in the world and are part of a comprehensive programme to
        reduce emissions from London's bus fleet.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>To date, six bus routes in
        London have been served by around 170 New Routemasters. By 2016 there will be
        600 of these new buses on London's streets reducing CO2 emissions in
        the capital by around 20,600 tonnes a year.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Route 38, which is operated by
        Arriva, has had New Routemasters introduced on a phased basis with full
        conversion now complete. It runs between
        Victoria Station and Hackney, via Hyde Park Corner, Green Park, Piccadilly
        Circus, Bloomsbury, Islington, Dalston, Hackney Central Station and Clapton
        Pond. </p>
        <p>It was the route on which the very first prototype New Routemaster
        entered service in February 2012. At night, route
        N38 has an extended service running additionally via Lea Bridge,
        Leyton (Bakers Arms) and Walthamstow Central which will also be served by New
        Routemaster buses.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Buses on route 38 operate with the
        rear door open and a conductor on the rear platform for the majority of the day
        on weekdays (6am&#45;7pm Monday to Friday) on the busiest section of the route
        between Essex Road (Islington) and Victoria. On the remainder of the route, in
        the evenings, at weekends and on the route N38 at night the rear platform is
        closed when the bus is moving but all three sets of doors are opened and closed
        by the driver at bus stops. During peaks hours, 59 of these state of the art
        buses are in passenger service to carry the 42,000 people who travel on the
        route each week day.
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        In addition, the routes 8 and N8 are now also served entirely by New
        Routemasters. Operated by Stagecoach, it runs for 24-hours a day and has seen
        New Routemasters introduced on a phased basis with full conversion now
        complete. The route normally runs between
        Oxford Circus and Bow Church via Tottenham Court Road, Holborn, St Paul's,
        Bank, Liverpool Street, Shoreditch and Bethnal Green,
        although until autumn 2014 it terminates at Tottenham Court Road due to
        roadworks. </p>
        <p>At night, route N8 has an extended service running additionally via
        Stratford, Leytonstone, and Gants to Hainault which is now also served by New
        Routemaster buses. Buses on route 8 and N8
        operate with the rear platform closed when the bus is moving, with large
        numbers of passengers able to quickly board and alight using all three sets of
        doors and two staircases at bus stops.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>During peak hours, 30 of the new
        buses are in passenger service to carry the 22,000 passengers
        who travel on the route each weekday.
        &nbsp;
        The introduction of New Routemaster
        buses is part of a comprehensive programme to reduce emissions from London's
        bus fleet which includes 1,700 hybrids on the street by 2016, accelerating the
        introduction of ultra low emission Euro VI buses and retrofitting older buses
        to reduce their NOx emissions by up to 88 per cent.
        &nbsp;
        Four New Routemasters with a Euro
        VI engine are currently being tested in passenger service with full production
        of the New Routemaster with the Euro VI engine starting later this year.

        <ul>
            <li>In tests, a New
            Routemaster prototype bus was found to emit a quarter of the NOx (Oxides
            of Nitrogen) and harmful 'PM' particles of a fleet average hybrid bus and
            20 per cent less CO2.Arriva is one of the
            largest providers of passenger transport in Europe, employing some 54,500
            people and delivering more than 2.2 billion passenger journeys every year.
            </li>
            <li>Arriva is part of Deutsche Bahn, one of the world's leading passenger
            transport and logistics service providers, and operates in 14 European
            countries. Headquartered in Sunderland, Arriva is responsible for Deutsche
            Bahn's regional passenger transport services outside of Germany.Stagecoach is one of
            UK's biggest bus and coach operators with around 8,000 buses and coaches.
            </li>
            <li>Around 2.5 million passengers travel on Stagecoach's buses every day on a
            network stretching from south-west England to the Highlands and Islands of
            Scotland. The Group's business includes major city bus operations in
            London, Liverpool, Newcastle,&nbsp;Hull,&nbsp;Manchester, Oxford,
            Sheffield and Cambridge. Low-cost coach service, megabus.com, operates
            between around 60 towns and cities across the UK.</li>
            <li>The New Routemaster
            buses are manufactured by the family-owned Wrightbus company in Northern
            Ireland.&nbsp; The order for 600 vehicles resulted in the opening of a new
            chassis plant in Antrim and the safeguarding of 220 jobs, including 18
            apprenticeships and the creation of 50 new jobs.</li>
            <li>As well as the
            manufacture of the chassis and superstructure in Northern Ireland, a
            number of components for the bus are made by companies from around the UK;
            including engines from Darlington, seats from Telford, seat moquette from
            Huddersfield, wheelchair ramps from Hoddesdon (Hertfordshire), destination
            blinds from Middleton near Manchester and flooring from Liskeard
            (Cornwall). All of these companies have received a boost as a result of
            the new bus project.</li>
