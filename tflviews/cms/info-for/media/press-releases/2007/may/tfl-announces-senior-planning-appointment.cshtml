<p>In this role, they have been responsible for the highly successful design and implementation of the world leading Central London Congestion Charging scheme in early 2003, the subsequent western extension to the zone earlier this year and the strategy, design and procurement of services leading to the implementation of the London Low Emission Zone, the world's largest scheme of its kind, which will go-live in February 2008. </p>
<h2>Consultancy experience</h2>

<p>Both have 30 years of experience of transport planning, public transport, traffic engineering and project management. </p>
<p>Michele Dix joined the Greater London Council (GLC) after her PhD and became a chartered civil engineer through the GLC's transport planning graduate scheme.</p>
<p>She later worked for Halcrow Fox where she gained 15 years of international planning consultancy experience, becoming a board director with responsibility for UK urban transport planning.</p>
<p>Her work covered major studies such as the DfT's London to South West multi-modal study and the Airport Strategy for the South.</p>
