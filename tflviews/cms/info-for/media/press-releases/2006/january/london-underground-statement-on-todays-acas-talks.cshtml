            <p>An LU spokesperson said: "London Underground went to ACAS today to constructively discuss new issues raised by the RMT around the shorter working week deal. </p>
<p>"The RMT responded by immediately threatening a further escalation of the strike action called on New Years Eve. </p>
<p>"The issue in dispute is not about safety and does not involve job losses. It is an attempt to rewrite an agreement reached with the RMT and TSSA unions which the RMT itself previously hailed as 'groundbreaking'. </p>
<p>"The new rosters have already been agreed by 40 out of the 44 station groups. </p>
<p>"If they were to be suspended it would create chaos, delaying the 35-hour week, compromising staff holiday arrangements and denying other benefits to the vast majority of staff.</p>
<p>"The RMT is well aware of the fact that the procedures for resolving outstanding issues are by no means exhausted. </p>
<h2>'Return to negotiations'</h2>
<p>"The RMT should return to the negotiations and resolve any issues they have by discussion. </p>
<p>"We remain committed to resolving this dispute at any time and with the least possible inconvenience to Londoners."</p>
<p>If the strike goes ahead it would affect services from 1830 on Sunday evening and all day Monday.</p>
<p>As on New Year's Eve, LU would again seek to run the best service possible on these days.</p>
