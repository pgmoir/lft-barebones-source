</ul>
<p>Transport for London (TfL) today advised customers of likely service levels should planned strike action by RMT members who work in Tube stations go ahead next week.</p>
<p>If the strikes go ahead there will be a significant impact on Tube journeys over the period 2000 on Sunday 5 February until around 0900 Wednesday 8 February.</p>
<p>During the strike action many Tube stations, including most stations in Zone 1, will not open or, in some cases, may open or close at short notice. Where possible, TfL will run services between open stations, which will mostly be at the end of Tube lines outside central London. Customers should check before they travel, allow more time for their journey and avoid the peak times if they can.</p>
<p>It is currently projected that the impact of the strikes will mean:</p>
<p>Sunday 5 February</p>
<ul>
    <li>Stations will begin to close at 2000 &#45; customers should complete their Tube journeys by this time</li>
</ul>
<p>Monday 6 February</p>
<ul>
    <li>There will be no Tube service between 0530 and 0700</li>
    <li>There will be a very limited service from 0700 &#45; customers should re-plan their journeys</li>
    <li>Stations will begin to reopen from 1600 &#45; customers should check before they travel</li>
</ul>
<p>Tuesday 7 February</p>
<ul>
    <li>There will be a normal service until 1200</li>
    <li>Stations will begin to close from 1200 and there will be a very limited service &#45; customers should re-plan their journeys</li>
    <li>Service will finish at 2000. Customers should complete journeys by this time</li>
</ul>
<p>Wednesday 8 February</p>
<ul>
    <li>There will be no Tube service between 0530 and 0700</li>
    <li>There will be a very limited service from 0700 until 0800</li>
    <li>There will be a limited service from 0800 to 0900</li>
    <li>Normal service is expected to resume at 0900</li>
</ul>

<p>During the action, TfL will open as many stations as possible but it is very likely that many, particularly those in Zone 1, will not open at all or will close at short notice. This is because, for safety reasons, stations deep underground cannot be kept open unless a minimum number of staff are present. TfL will, however, try to open some key Zone 1 stations where possible.</p>
<p>TfL will use the services it is able to run to get as many people as close to central London as possible. Bus services, particularly those from National Rail stations, will be exceptionally busy, so customers are advised is to complete journeys from these stations by foot if at all possible. Customers less able to walk are advised to use buses and to allow more time for journeys. For information on walking times between Tube stations visit <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/walking">www.tfl.gov.uk/walking</a>.</p>
<p>People should only drive into and through central London if absolutely essential because road journeys will take significantly longer than usual. If customers cannot avoid driving, they should use the North and South Circular and/or the M25 around the Capital.</p>
<p>TfL has committed to recruit at least 650 new station staff this year, of which 325 will be additional new roles. Talks are ongoing at ACAS this week to provide clarification on the implementation of these proposals.</p>
<p>Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: </p>
<p>'If the strike by the RMT goes ahead we will be working hard to minimise disruption as much as possible and doing our best to help customers travel around the Capital. Tube journeys from 2000 on Sunday 5 February until around 0900 Wednesday 8 February are likely to be severely impacted.</p>
<p>'Our plan is to use the services we are able to run to get as many people as close to central London as possible. There will be posters, digital boards and announcements in stations to keep people informed of the latest level of service and all customers are advised to check before they travel using our website and live update tools.</p>
<p>'We have made a proposal to both unions in order to end this dispute and will be recruiting at least 650 new station staff this year, of which 325 will be additional new roles. I urge the RMT to keep talking with us and not disrupt the lives of Londoners.'</p>
<p>Further travel advice and maps indicating the expected levels of service can be found on <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike">tfl.gov.uk/tube-strike</a>, while the live update services can be found on Twitter &#64;TfLTravelAlerts, &#64;TfLTrafficNews and &#64;TfLBusAlerts.</p>

Notes to Editors:<br />
<ul>
    <li>As part of the 325 additional new roles, there will be more than 100 supervisor roles. This will increase promotion opportunities for existing station staff.</li>
    <li>Following consultation with the trade unions and an internal review of staffing levels, we have committed to increase the number of new staff recruited from 200 to 325.</li>
    <li>The work to recruit these additional staff is already well underway.</li>
    <li>Other recruitment to at least 650 new station staff this year reflects anticipated turnover for people who leave, retire or move to other roles within TfL</li>
