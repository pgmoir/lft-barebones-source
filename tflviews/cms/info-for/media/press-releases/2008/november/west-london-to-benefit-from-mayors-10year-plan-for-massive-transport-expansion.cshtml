            <p>The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today outlined his plan for the future of London's transport system as he launched Transport for London's&nbsp;(TfL's)&nbsp;multi-billion pound 10-year Business Plan.</p>
<p>The Plan, which will help deliver an almost 30 per cent&nbsp;increase in the Capital's public transport network by 2018, includes massive transport improvements in West London including Crossrail, the upgrades of the District, Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines, improvements to the London Overground network, measures to smooth traffic flow for road users and a huge investment to begin a revolution in cycling and walking. </p>
<h2>Tough decisions</h2>
<p>However, the Mayor made clear that the current challenging economic times follow the former Mayor's promises of schemes for which there was never any money, ultimately leading to some tough decisions about which projects the plan will fund.</p>
<p>The Mayor said: 'A good transport system is essential to improving quality of life, as the more time Londoners spend shoehorned onto trains, Tube carriages or buses, the less time they have to themselves or to spend with their families.</p>
<p>'So we have to build a better system, and in this important moment for our city we are committing to building our transport infrastructure with Brunelian endeavour and scale, investing billions to create a network that Londoners will recognise as vastly improved from the one we have now. </p>
<p>'We will upgrade the Tube, build Crossrail, capture the legacy of the 2012 Games, and create thousands of jobs, helping to boost the capacity of our public transport network by almost 30 per cent. </p>
<h2>Better network</h2>
<p>'Smoothing traffic flows will help get the most from our road system.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'And we will both revolutionise cycling and walking, and sustain investment in transport policing so that we deliver not only a bigger and better network, but also a safer one, making London an even better place to live.'</p>
<p>The transport improvements for West London in the TfL Business Plan include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>London Underground </strong>- the District line will be upgraded to provide additional capacity and new rolling stock with air conditioning will be introduced on the Tube's sub-surface network with Metropolitan line customers the first to benefit. Piccadilly line customers will also get new trains by 2014. Signalling systems on the Tube will also be upgraded to allow the operation of faster, more frequent services across the District, Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines </li>
<li><strong>Crossrail</strong> - construction will begin in 2010, greatly improving transport services for those living in west London when it opens in 2017 and will offer new journey opportunities to central London, Docklands and further afield. Crossrail will be the largest addition to the transport network in London and the South East for more than 50 years, running 118km from Maidenhead in the west to Ealing Broadway and through central London to Abbey Wood and Shenfield in the east </li>
<li><strong>London Overground </strong>- the upgrade of London Overground's North London line from Richmond to Stratford via Willesden Junction is continuing and a fleet of brand new trains will be introduced from 2009 providing additional capacity </li>
<li><strong>Oyster pay as you go on National Rail</strong> - the Mayor and TfL are aiming to ensure that Oyster pay as you go is available on all National Rail services in London by late 2009, a major boost to those west Londoners who use National Rail for journeys into central London but also for journeys south of the river where Oyster is not currently widely accepted </li>
<li><strong>Smoothing traffic flow</strong> - Road users in west London will benefit from the smoothing of traffic flows achieved through a range of measures including re-phasing traffic lights and through better coordination of road works </li>
<li><strong>Cycling and walking</strong> - The Mayor aims to increase cycling throughout London by 400 per cent by 2025 through three principle initiatives: a new cycle hire scheme; the creation of cycle highways to whisk commuters and others into central London; and cycle hubs in outer London to create beacons of cycling excellence across the city </li>
<li><strong>Local transport funding</strong> - TfL is also working more collaboratively with all of London's boroughs in providing continued annual funding for local transport improvements through the boroughs' Local Implementation Plans. Funding for all London's boroughs for 2009/10 will be announced shortly&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>The Mayor today underlined the importance of continued high-level investment in transport infrastructure to create thousands of jobs for Londoners, boost the economy through uncertain times, and ensure London retains its pre-eminent global position.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But he also outlined how the uncertain economic climate means that tough choices need to be made and that a new approach of realism needs to be applied to prospective projects.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Mayor recognises, now more than ever, that TfL must make efficiencies and spend public money wisely given that Londoners are watching their outgoings in these challenging times.</p>
<p>In a departure from the old administration, the Mayor has instructed TfL to focus on delivering on time and budget the projects that will give the greatest benefits to Londoners, and not to proceed with spending money on projects that are yet to receive the necessary funding from Government and other sources. </p>
<h2>Real benefits</h2>
<p>Commenting on the tough decisions required to ensure a balanced and sustainable transport plan, the Mayor said:&nbsp;'London is the engine of the UK economy and it is vital that we continue to invest in better transport during these tough times. </p>
<p>'But at the same time, we need to focus on the projects that deliver real benefits for Londoners, and let go of those that lack the funding for completion.</p>
<p>'These projects still required a total of more than &pound;3bn in funding from the Government or other sources. </p>
<p>'At a time when Londoners are struggling it is our duty to get maximum bang for their buck and invest in fully funded schemes that we know can be delivered.</p>
<p>'I will not continue with the former Mayor's unrealistic and hollow promises.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Cost efficiency</h2>
<p>'The last administration's commitments amounted to billions of pounds worth of schemes that London could simply never afford.'</p>
<p>Transport Commissioner Peter Hendy said: 'The Mayor has set out his vision for the future and TfL's task is to deliver on time and on budget. I am confident we will.</p>
<p>'Alongside this massive investment is the need to deliver clear value for money for London's taxpayers and farepayers, to maximise the cost efficiency of TfL enabling fares to be kept affordable over the longer term.</p>
<p>'TfL has responded to this challenge by identifying &pound;2.4bn in savings and efficiencies that we have built into our funding calculations and will use to help deliver key projects such as improving the Tube, expanding London Overground and enabling the construction of Crossrail. </p>
<p>'And we will continue to look for more savings including through a major review of London's bus network.<br></p>
