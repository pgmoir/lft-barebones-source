            <p>Forward beat off competition from Haymarket Publishing, the Redwood Group and incumbents John Brown Citrus Publishing to secure the two-year contract, with an option to extend for a further year. </p>
<p>The contract was competitively tendered through the Official Journal of the European Union, which was issued in April. </p>
<p>London Loop will launch at the end of November and will be distributed to nearly a quarter of a million season ticket Tube and bus customers. </p>
<p>The new magazine replaces London's Underground's (LU) successful Tube magazine. </p>
<p>Launched in 2002, Tube was a quarterly 44-page compact-sized magazine sent to 130,000 LU customers who have a season ticket travel card. </p>
<p>Liz Norris, LU Strategic Marketing Manager, said: "After a competitive pitch process it was clear the Forward Group had the creative edge we were looking for to help launch London Loop magazine. </p>
<p>"It has been very important for us in the last three years to communicate the work of London Underground to our solid customer base through Tube magazine. </p>
<p>"Now incorporating the bus network, the new London Loop magazine will allow us to connect to an even bigger audience in a friendly and informative way."</p>
<p>The launch of London Loop will meet the growing customer needs of London Bus users, who did not have their own magazine. </p>
<h2>Growing demand</h2>
<p>Passenger numbers on the London Bus network have grown considerably in recent years and have now reached 6.3 million passenger journeys each day. </p>
<p>Last year the Tube carried more passengers than ever before. </p>
<p>Both the Tube and the London Bus network are the backbone of London's public transport system and have a passenger profile that is increasingly interchanging between the two forms of transport. </p>
<p>Tube passenger research indicated that there was a growing demand for their customer magazine to contain London Bus, as well as Tube-specific, information.</p>
<p>London Loop will continue to be published in A5 format and will include news, real-life reader stories and competitions. </p>
<p>Content in the 44-page magazine will be evenly spread between London Underground and London Bus issues.<br></p>
