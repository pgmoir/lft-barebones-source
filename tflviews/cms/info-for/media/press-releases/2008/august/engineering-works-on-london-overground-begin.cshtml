            <p>The work, which includes upgrading tracks, strengthening bridges and widening a tunnel, will enable the more efficient routing of both freight and passenger services at points where the two share tracks. </p>
<p>This will enable Transport for London (TfL) to run a better and more reliable passenger service.</p>
<p>The works from September to mid-November 2008 by Network Rail will lead to the short-term closures of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gospel Oak to Willesden Junction line from: 1 September to 17 November&nbsp; </li>
<li>Gospel Oak to Barking line from: 1 September&nbsp; to 29 September&nbsp; </li>
<li>Gospel Oak to Camden Road from: 22 September&nbsp;to 29 September&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>TfL is providing a replacement bus service and an alternative rail service during the works. </p>
<p>TfL London Rail Managing Director, Ian Brown, said: 'These works are key to introducing most of the service improvements we promised to deliver when we took over this network last year.</p>
<p>'In the short term these works will bring some inconvenience for passengers, but we would ask them to please bear with us for a huge long term gain. </p>
<p>'We are committed to keeping passengers connected to the network and will run an alternative train service and replacement buses. </p>
<p>'We also urge people to consider alternative routes using the Tube and other rail services.'</p>
<p>TfL has worked with passenger groups and the local press to give local residents as much information and advance warning as possible about the works, and the alternative routes that will be made available to them. </p>
<p>Passengers will still be able to connect with London's rail and Tube network using a Monday to Saturday service which will run from Watford Junction to Stratford, although no services will call at Euston on these days. </p>
<p>A three train per hour Watford Junction to Euston service will run on Sundays.</p>
<p>There will be three alternative bus services around the closed sections of the network, with four buses an hour calling at most staffed stations along the railway.<br></p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Passengers' first choice in finding an alternative way to make their journeys should be via the Victoria, Bakerloo, Metropolitan Tube lines, other surface rail services and bus services. London Overground has liaised with these operators and they are confident their services can handle the temporary increase in numbers. Visit&nbsp; <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner">Journey Planner </a>to plan your route </li>
<li>London Overground is providing extra staff at key stations to assist customers and all stations will still have staff on duty to assist with queries </li>
<li>There will be a Monday to Saturday rail service using three tph (trains per hour) Watford to Stratford using the Primrose Hill freight link. These will be supported by train services from Stratford stopping at stations to Camden Road. There will be no services at all into Euston except on Sunday when there will be a three tph service </li>
<li>Clapham Junction to Willesden Junction services will have two tph Monday to Saturday and one tph on Sundays. This is one less than is provided now; this is to avoid train congestion at Willesden Junction caused by the temporary train service plan </li>
<li>Three alternative bus services of four buses per hour will be provided by single decker buses. We urge passengers to use these to get to their closest Tube and alternative rail stations </li>
<li>It is not possible to use double decker buses because of low bridges on the routes </li>
<li>Passengers will receive compensation if they purchased their ticket before information about the engineering works was made public (30 May&nbsp;2008). Claimants will have to supply proof of home and work address </li>
<li>The London Overground Customer Services team will respond to enquiries regarding the services from the 30 May, by phone on 0845 601 4867 or email on <a href="mailto:overgroundinfo&#64;tfl.gov.uk">overgroundinfo&#64;tfl.gov.uk</a> </li>
<li>A detailed powerpoint presentation of the replacement bus service, map and other information is available on request<br></li></ul>
