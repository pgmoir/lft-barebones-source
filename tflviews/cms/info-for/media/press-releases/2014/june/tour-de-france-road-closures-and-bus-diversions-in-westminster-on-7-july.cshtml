        <p>With less than a month to go until the world's largest annual
        sporting event comes to the City of Westminster, Transport for London (TfL) is
        holding a local information session to keep Londoners informed about the event.</p>
        <p>The iconic Tour de France will roll onto the streets of London on
        Monday 7 July bringing out hundreds of thousands of Londoners and visitors to
        see this spectacle.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        On
        the day, a large number of road closures around the route will be in place so
        people are advised to&nbsp; plan their&nbsp; travel in advance. Road closures for the event will begin after the morning peak at
        10:00, with roads reopening as quickly as possible once the Tour has passed
        through and it is safe to do so. TfL anticipates that all roads will be
        reopened by 18:00. Pedestrians will be able to cross the route at key crossing
        points and we are working with local businesses close to the route to ensure
        that disruption is kept to a minimum.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Roads closed in Westminster &#45; in
            addition to the route &#45; will include Horse
            Guards
            Road, Pall Mall and roads around the Methodist Central Hall
            </li>
            <li>Whitehall, the Strand, Trafalgar Square
            and Charing Cross Road will be closed to through traffic</li>
            <li>A contra-flow will be in place on the
            southern side of Parliament
            Square,
            enabling vehicles to travel in both directions between Victoria Street and
            Millbank </li>
            <li>Piccadilly
            and Shaftesbury Avenue will remain open</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Tower, Southwark and Westminster Bridges will be closed for much
        of the day but there are no planned closures on any other major river crossings
        in central London.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>An
        extensive programme of public engagement&nbsp;and communication around the
        arrival of the Tour de France in the capital is now underway similar to that
        developed during the London 2012 Olympics, to help businesses and the public plan and get
        around on the day and make the most of the return of the prestigious event.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Residents of the City of Westminster are invited to attend a
        public information session at Westminster City Hall on Wednesday 25 June
        between 16:00 and 19:00 which will allow members of the community to talk
        through the event and its impact on the local area with representatives from TfL.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        City of Westminster will be well and truly open for business, and people are
        encouraged to enjoy the atmosphere on their own roads that the riders and the
        publicity caravanne will create.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        city will be a great place to see the world's best riders as they pass iconic
        London landmarks such as Trafalgar Square, the Houses of Parliament, St James's
        Park and ending up with the final stretch down the Mall.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The Tour de
        France &#45; the world's largest annual sporting event &#45; comes to London on Monday
        7 July after the first two stages in Yorkshire. Around 200 elite cyclists will
        travel from Cambridge, through Essex, into London before a spectacular finish
        on The Mall.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The Tour de
        France will draw people onto the streets of London from near and far, and help
        to inspire more people to take up cycling. Hosting world renowned events such
        as the Tour reinforces London's reputation as a world-class host of cultural,
        sporting and business events. Visitors, both domestic and overseas, are brought
        to the capital by major events, delivering direct and indirect economic
        benefits, and showcasing London to a much wider audience.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Garrett Emmerson,
        Chief Operating Officer for Surface Transport at TfL, said: &quot;We've been working long and hard to
        plan for the return of the Tour to the capital and now we are asking Londoners
        to start their planning too.
        &nbsp;
        "We will keep the capital moving, and roads around the race
        route will, of course, be extremely busy.&nbsp; So we're asking people to plan
        ahead and preferably use public transport to make the most of what I'm sure
        will be an amazing day, helping to&nbsp;
        cement London's growing reputation as a major cycling city and encourage
        more Londoners to travel by bike.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Bus
        services around the route will be affected. Some bus services to and from Westminster
        will need to be diverted, temporarily suspended or terminate earlier than their
        usual destination, as a result of road closures. Affected local routes include:
        3, 6, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 23, 24, 29, 53, 87, 88, 91, 139, 148, 159, 176, 211
        and 453.
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p>
        Some
        stops will also be temporarily relocated or suspended. Routes 14, 19, 22, 38
        and 94 are not affected.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        Full
        details of road closures are available at <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance">tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Drivers are urged to plan ahead or to consider re-timing their journey to avoid
        disruption, particularly if people are planning to travel to or from airports
        or to a special event.

            <li>Session address: Room 1A &amp; 1B, Westminster City Hall, 64 Victoria St, SW1E 6QP</li>
            <li>The
            detailed Tour de France route is available on the TfL website at
            tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance. To avoid delays drivers are advised to, wherever
            possible, avoid areas&nbsp;near the event routes in the affected parts of
            Cambridgeshire, Essex and London. For up to date information on how transport
            services are operating, check before you travel at tfl.gov.uk and follow
            &#64;TfLTravelAlerts (Tube, DLR and London Overground), &#64;TfLTrafficNews (roads) and
            &#64;TfLBusAlerts (bus).
            &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>Tube and Rail will be the best way to get around the
            affected areas of London, with the vast majority of services in central
            London running as normal. The Circle and District lines are expected to be
            extremely busy as will stations along the route, particularly in Zone 1
            from midday until around 18:00</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France will kick off a spectacular summer of cycling in London, with
            the exciting event followed by Prudential RideLondon on the 9 and 10 August and
            then the Tour of Britain, which finishes in the capital on 14 September</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France is the world's largest annual sporting event and covers
            approximately 3,500kms. A worldwide television audience of 3.5billion people watch
            the event annually. There will be 190 countries broadcasting the Tour de France
            and there are 5,000 hours of TV coverage annually. The last time the Tour
            visited England was in 2007 when London hosted the Grand D&eacute;part,
            which is the opening of the race</li>
            <li>This
            summer's cycling events are likely to inspire thousands more Londoners to take
            to two wheels, building on the Mayor's ambition for cycling to be an integral
            part of the transport network. As part of his cycling vision, the Mayor is
            already engaging in a vast &pound;1billion programme of improvements&nbsp; - creating
            a series of enhanced cycling superhighways, urban 'quietways' for more cautious
            cyclists, and turning some outer boroughs into mini-Hollands</li>
            <li>For
            more information on the Mayor's Vision for Cycling visit <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/vision-for-cycling">http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/vision-for-cycling</a>
            &nbsp;
            </li>
            <li>The Mayor is committed to ensuring London retains its status as the
            world capital of sport, and has recently set up the Major Events Oversight
            Board. The board is chaired by Sir Edward Lister, and comprises of TfL, the
            emergency services and other key partner agencies. It provides strategic direction
            and advice to the Mayor on the approach to bidding, staging and evaluating
            major events in London. The board ensures that all major road events continue
            to be carefully considered and tightly managed to ensure everyone gets full
            benefit from the event without undue impact on Londoners and London's
            transport. The board also looks at ways to ensure the major events programme is
            effectively communicated with Londoners, visitors, businesses and stakeholders
            to allow sufficient notice and forward planning for everyone.</li>
