        New rules to drive dodgy minicabs off the road come into force from Tuesday 8th June the Public Carriage Office (PCO) announced today. Within the next ten months all minicabs in Greater London will have passed a stringent safety test ensuring passenger's safety and comfort.

<p>This marks the final stage in licensing London's private hire industry, which includes executive and chauffeur services, following on from operator and driving licensing. By April 2005, all licensed vehicles will have a distinctive new disc, fixed to the front and rear windscreens, showing that the car has met strict safety standards over and above its MOT.</p>
<p>Anyone using a vehicle to carry passengers for hire, unable to produce either a temporary permit or a full licence from the PCO will now be trading illegally. Owners can be fined up to &pound;2500.</p>
<p>The vehicle checks, which started in April, are similar to those carried out traditionally for black cabs. Examiners will be ensuring that the vehicles are safe, mechanically sound, comfortable and fit for the purpose of carrying passengers. </p>
<p>The standards include: </p>
<ul>
<li>a distinctive disc fixed to front and rear windscreens to identify the vehicle as a licensed private hire vehicle. No other signage is allowed; 
</li><li>for vehicles more than 12 months old the owner must produce a valid MOT certificate which must have been issued no more than 14 days prior to the inspection by the Public Carriage Office (PCO); 
</li><li>a mid-year MOT will be required ensuring that mechanical checks are carried out every six months on all licensed private hire vehicles; 
</li><li>the owner must produce valid insurance for the vehicle and it must be registered with the DVLA; 
</li><li>doors and door-locks must be in full working order; 
</li><li>seatbelts must be fitted to all passenger seats; 
</li><li>seating must be clean and comfortable; and 
</li><li>there must be adequate boot or luggage space. </li></ul>
<p>The PCO has been issuing temporary permits for private hire vehicle owners since March 5 2004 and currently 37,000 vehicles have registered. Vehicle inspections take place in Croydon, Woolwich, Hanworth and Enfield at special centres run by SGS (United Kingdom) Ltd on behalf of the PCO.</p>
<p>Private hire vehicles in London should only be booked through one of the 2,300 licensed private hire operators. Only licensed black cabs may be hailed on the street.</p>
            <ol>
<li>All 40,000 vehicles in the capital will be inspected annually by a contractor SGS (United Kingdom Ltd) working for TfL's Public Carriage Office (PCO). 
</li><li>Since 2001 minicab operators must hold a valid licence from the Public Carriage Office to run a service. Since 1st June 2003 it has been an offence to drive a minicab without a private hire driver's licence or a temporary permit issued by the PCO. </li></ol>
