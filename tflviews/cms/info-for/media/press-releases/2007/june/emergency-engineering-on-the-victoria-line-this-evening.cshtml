<p>Due to Metronet emergency engineering works at Brixton, the entire Victoria line will be completely suspended from 20:00 this evening (Wednesday 13 June) until around 22:30 when London Underground hope to run a limited service between Victoria and Walthamstow only.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Over the last couple of days there has been disruption on the Victoria line, due to a track fault at Brixton. </p>
<p>Due to the nature of the fault it is necessary to carry out the works to fix it outside normal engineering hours. </p>
<p>Two rail replacement bus services will operate, one between Woodford on the Central line and Blackhorse Road, the other between the Elephant and Castle on the Bakerloo and Northern lines and Brixton.</p>
<p>Customers are advised to seek alternative routes and London Underground tickets will also be accepted on local bus and train services. </p>
<p>London Underground apologises for any inconvenience this temporary closure may cause and advises passengers to check before travelling via the following options:</p>
