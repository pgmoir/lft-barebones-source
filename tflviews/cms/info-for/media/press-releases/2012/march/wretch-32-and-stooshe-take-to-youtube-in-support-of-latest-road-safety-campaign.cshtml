            <p>Transport for London's (TfL's) campaign to reduce the number of teenage road casualties in the capital goes viral this morning as Wretch 32 and London girl band Stooshe take to YouTube today with clips reminding their fans to take care when using London roads.</p>
<p>The stars join previous Road Safety Ambassadors including Tinie Tempah, Rizzle Kicks, Tinchy Stryder, Mz Bratt and Being Human stars Russell Tovey&nbsp;and Lenora Crichlow and donated their time free of charge to record the clip.</p>
<p>Tottenham-born Wretch 32 is a committed supporter of the campaign, recording his second clip in two years.</p>
<h2>Talking to teens</h2>
<p>TfL's latest teen road safety campaign 'Stop.Think.Live.' uses a range of powerful messages to remind young teenagers to take care when using the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alongside these 'shout outs', new campaign posters will be on display across London featuring striking images to show the consequences of being distracted on the road.</p>
<p>A poster of a boy lying motionless on the road and clutching a mobile phone carries the strapline 'My friend saw the text. He didn't see the car.'</p>
<h2>Online game launch</h2>
<p>Next week sees the release of an online game, which can only be played on desktop PCs or laptops.</p>
<p>It challenges the player to navigate themselves and their friends safely through London's roads.</p>
<p>The game highlights the importance of looking out for more than one person when on the road.</p>
<p>These tactics are the latest in a series of highly commended campaigns aiming to reduce the number of teenagers killed or seriously injured on London roads.</p>
<h2>Getting the message</h2>
<p>Figures suggest teenagers are heeding safety messages - the 2010 road casualty figures revealed that there had been 14 per cent fewer teenage deaths or serious injuries on the capital's roads with 258 teenagers (aged 13-19) killed or seriously injured, compared with 301 in 2009.</p>
<p>Overall, the number of teenagers killed or seriously injured has fallen by almost 62 per cent since the campaign started in 2000.</p>
<p>Ben Plowden, Director of Planning, Surface Transport at TfL said: 'Transport for London is committed to reducing the number of teenage road casualties.</p>
<p>'The new posters address the many distractions teenagers may face while nearby or using the road. This is an important part of our ongoing work to save lives, the campaign builds on the success of previous years with the number of casualties falling every year.'</p>
<p>The ideas behind the campaign are a result of in-depth research into teenage behaviour, which has won an award from the Market Research Society.</p>
<p>The work is part of TfL's ongoing commitment to reach young people in ways are relevant to them.</p>
