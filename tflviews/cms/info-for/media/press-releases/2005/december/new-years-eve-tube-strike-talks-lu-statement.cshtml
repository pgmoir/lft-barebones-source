                        <p>
                            We remain ready to talk to the RMT at any time to resolve this issue

            <p>An LU spokesperson said: "We are dismayed that the RMT is once again proposing to hold London to ransom over the festive period. </p>
<p>"The whole basis of the shorter working week deal is to improve customer service and staff visibility on the network. </p>
<p>"London Underground has been quite correctly implementing the deal hailed a year ago as 'groundbreaking' by the RMT leadership and supported by the membership by a margin of 30-1. </p>
<p>"The RMT is effectively asking LU to dismantle the process and timetable that implements the deal. This is unacceptable to LU and our customers.</p>
<p>"We remain ready to talk to the RMT at any time to resolve this issue. </p>
<p>"This agreed deal is good for London Underground, the RMT's members, and is good for London.</p>
<p>"If the strike does go ahead, London Underground will seek to run services where it is safe to do so."</p>
