<p>John Barry, Head of Network Development, London Buses, said: 'The 24-hour service on route 365 will provide valuable night time links for residents of Havering and is an important addition to London's expanding night bus network.'</p>
<p>The number of night bus services in London has increased significantly in recent years with passenger numbers more than doubling since 2000.</p>
<p>Almost half the users are people travelling to or from work.</p>
