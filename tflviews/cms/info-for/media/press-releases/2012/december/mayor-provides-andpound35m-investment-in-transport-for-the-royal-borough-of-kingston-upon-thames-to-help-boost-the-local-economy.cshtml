<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced &pound;3.5m for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.</p>
<p>The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>The &pound;3.5m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of projects in Kingston including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;1,385,000 for improvements to Tolworth Broadway.&nbsp;Works will include improving pedestrian crossings, decluttering footways, changing loading and parking arrangements to improve traffic access as well improving cycle parking facilities. This is the remaining part of the &pound;2,010,000 allocation made available across the two financial years 2012/13 and 2013/14</li>
<li>&pound;387,000 for a programme to tackle safety and access to local schools</li>
<li>&pound;281,000 to make cycling safer and easier through cycle training and improvements to cycle paths. This is in addition to &pound;100,000 from the Biking Borough programme that Kingston receives</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:&nbsp;'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Kingston. </p>
<p>'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'</p>
<p>This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be coordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said:&nbsp;'We are working in partnership with Kingston and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>Last year in Kingston, it funded 87 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 1,522 children and 71 adults, two improved pedestrian crossings, nine accessible bus stops, for 33 schools to participate walking events and two new 20mph zones.</p>
<p>Notable larger projects undertaken this year in Kingston include improvements to&nbsp; Ewell Road, which received &pound;250,000 to improve bus lanes, parking and loading, pedestrian crossings and public realm improvements at the shopping parades. </p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<p>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp; While individual projects are the responsibility of each borough.</p>
