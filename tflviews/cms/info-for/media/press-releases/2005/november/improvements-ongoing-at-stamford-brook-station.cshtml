            <p>The refurbishment works are part of Transport for London's (TfL) 5-Year &pound;10bn investment programme.</p>
<p>During the nine-day station closure, trains will not stop at Stamford Brook, and no ticketing issuing facilities will be available.</p>
<p>The majority of works to be undertaken during the closure will take place in the ticket office and will involve the removal of internal walls.</p>
<p>The work, to be undertaken by Metronet Rail SSL, will take advantage of track improvement works and the scheduled suspension of services between Hammersmith and Acton Town/Gunnersbury on the weekends of 14-15 January and 21-22 January 2006 to accelerate improvements.</p>
<p>A bus replacement service will operate on weekdays 16-20 January from Stamford Brook to Turnham Green every 5 minutes during peak times and every 10 minutes during the off-peak period.</p>
<p>On the weekends of 14-15 and 21-22 January 2006, a replacement bus service will operate calling at all stations from Hammersmith to Acton Town/Gunnersbury.</p>
