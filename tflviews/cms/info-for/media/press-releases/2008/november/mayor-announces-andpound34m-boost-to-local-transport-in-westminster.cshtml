            <p>The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced &pound;3.4m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for Westminster to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.&nbsp; </p> <p>As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to &pound;168.3m from &pound;161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.</p> <p>TfL has included &pound;100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses. </p> <p>The &pound;3.4m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:</p> <ul> <li>&pound;240,000 for road renewal works on Great George Street to repair any uneven surfaces, potholes and cracks.&nbsp;This will improve journeys and safety for all road users  </li><li>&pound;290,000 to improve cycling provision in the Cannon Street area.&nbsp;Measures will include the removal of gyratory or introduction of two way cycling on one way streets, traffic calming and streetscape enhancements.&nbsp; Removal of the one-way system will improve accessibility through Mansion House junction for all modes of traffic  </li><li>&pound;100,000 continue the ongoing walking funded works in the Halfpenny Bridge location. The scheme will improve the quality of the public realm and improve crossing points over the Grand Union Canal which will, in turn, improve the connectivity between Harrow Road and Kensal Town for pedestrians and support the economic regeneration of the Harrow Road shopping area. 2009/10 funding is focused specifically on improving the Great Western Road link between Westbourne Park Tube station and Harrow Road  </li><li>&pound;50,000 to help fund the installation of six electrical recharging points in the borough. They will provide an alternative energy source which aims to improve local air quality for businesses, residents, visitors and fleet operators by assisting in reducing CO2 emissions</li></ul> <p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'When I was elected I promised I would be different and give greater freedom to the boroughs.</p> <p>'This is why this year I have introduced a &pound;100,000 award for Boroughs to spend as they choose. </p> <p>'Boroughs are being given greater freedom to develop and deliver the schemes they want, which means more choice over a range of key local schemes to improve town centres and cycling facilities, tackle the school run and improve local roads.<br>&nbsp;<br>'I am awarding Westminster a budget of &pound;3.4m next year for local schemes that will make travelling safer, more accessible and more environment-friendly, helping to improve the quality of life for people across the borough.'</p> <p>Funding for local transport schemes is allocated each year by TfL in response to the applications from boroughs based on their Local Implementation [transport] Plans (LIPs). Funding is currently available for a wide range of programmes including road safety, maintaining borough roads, tackling the school run, improving walking, cycling and the local environment, making transport more accessible and measures to improve bus journeys.&nbsp; </p> <p> <hr>  <p> <p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Below is a table with a breakdown of Local Implementation Plan funding for Westminster:</li></ul> <blockquote> <div class="table-container"><table cellspacing="1" cellpadding="1" width="75%" border="1"> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Bus priority</td> <td>&nbsp;1,000,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Bus stop accessibility</td> <td>&nbsp;84,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Education, training, publicity</td> <td>&nbsp;15,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Environment</td> <td>&nbsp;50,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;London Cycling Network +</td> <td>&nbsp;340,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Accessibility</td> <td>&nbsp;60,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Local Safety Schemes</td> <td>&nbsp;562,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Cycling</td> <td>&nbsp;95,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Principal road renewal</td> <td>&nbsp;730,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;School travel plans</td> <td>&nbsp;219,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Travel awareness </td> <td>&nbsp;14,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Walking</td> <td>&nbsp;100,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;Trial funding</td> <td>&nbsp;100,000</td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td><strong>&nbsp;TOTAL</strong></td> <td>&nbsp;3,369,000</td></tr></tbody></table></div></blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li>Each London borough has a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) approved by the Mayor containing proposals to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp; While TfL allocates funding for individual schemes, LIP and individual project delivery is the responsibility of each borough  </li><li>A School Travel Plan is a package of measures, tailored to the needs of individual schools to deliver alternative transport methods for the school run, aiming to reduce single occupancy car journeys to school, cut congestion and increase safety near schools  </li><li>Priorities for Local Implementation Plans include:  <ul type="circle"> <li>Improving road safety  </li><li>Encouraging walking and cycling  </li><li>Improving bus journey times and reliability  </li><li>Relieving traffic congestion and improving journey time reliability  </li><li>Improving the working of parking and loading arrangements  </li><li>Improving accessibility for all on the transport network  </li><li>Bringing transport infrastructure into a state of good repair  </li><li>School travel planning </li></ul> <li>NB funding can be broken down by LIP programmes as above once final allocations have been approved  </li><li>Electrical charging points: <br>A total of &pound;390k has been allocated to 12 Boroughs to install a further 70 points across London.
