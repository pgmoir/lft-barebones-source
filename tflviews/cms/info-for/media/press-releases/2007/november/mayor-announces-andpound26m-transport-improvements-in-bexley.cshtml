<p>The &pound;2.6m funding includes &pound;400,000 for better facilities for pedestrians and bus users in Nuxley Road and Albert Road in Belvedere, &pound;345,000 for more cycle lanes and better facilities for cyclists in Bexley as part of the London Cycle Network+ and &pound;50,000 for new pedestrian crossing facilities and lighting improvements at Ruxley Corner.</p>
<p>The funding is part of the record-breaking five-year &pound;792m programme for local transport schemes included in the Transport for London (TfL) &pound;10bn Investment Programme.</p>
<p>Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: "This new &pound;2.6m investment in local transport schemes will make the daily journeys of people in Bexley, safer, greener and more accessible, whether they are travelling by public transport, by car, on foot or by bike.</p>
<p>"Thanks to extra investment in local transport schemes, cycling has increased by 83 per cent since 2000 and more than 1,600 school travel plans have been approved which encourage and enable more children and their parents to walk to school." </p>
<h2>Local transport improvements</h2>

<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said:&nbsp;"This &pound;2.6m will go towards directly improving transport for people in Bexley.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"Local people feel strongly about transport in their area and this funding will make a real difference to their experience each day.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>"The investment will fund both large and small projects that will improve bus journeys and access to public transport, reduce congestion, improve the environment and promote a healthier lifestyle. </p>
<p>"This funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in the boroughs to make improvements to local transport."</p>

<ul>
<li>&pound;345,000 for the London Cycle Network+ in Bexley </li>
<li>&pound;90,000 for 20mph zones in the borough to improve safety in local streets </li>
