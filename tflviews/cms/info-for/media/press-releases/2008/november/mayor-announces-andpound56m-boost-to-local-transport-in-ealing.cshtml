<p>The Mayor of London Boris Johnson today announced &pound;5.6m of funding from Transport for London (TfL) for the Ealing to deliver local transport improvements during the financial year 2009/10.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This represents an approximate 14 per cent increase on &pound;4.8m received last year.</p>
<p>As well as increasing next year's local transport funding from TfL - up to &pound;168.3m from &pound;161m in 2008/09 - the Mayor also confirmed that London's boroughs will have greater freedom in choosing local transport projects.</p>
<p>TfL has included &pound;100,000 for the borough council to spend locally on transport as it chooses. </p>
<p>The &pound;5.6m package will allow the borough to finance several schemes to improve local transport for residents including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;1m for the Improvements to the Greenford Town Centre which will see the introduction of new crossing points in Greenford road, better layout of the Costons Lane and Ruislip Road junction, new paving, trees, flower beds and hanging baskets as well as defined spaces for parking and better lighting. These measures will provide residents with a safer, more accessible and more pleasant town centre </li>
<li>&pound;660,000 for the local safety schemes for Southall Broadway and Ruislip Road which aim to cut the number of road deaths and accidents thanks to pedestrian crossing facilities. Footways will be widened, anti-skid treatment applied to the road and the lighting improved </li>
<li>&pound;85,000 to help fund the installation of 22 electrical recharging points in the borough. They will provide an alternative energy source which aims to improve local air quality for businesses, residents, visitors and fleet operators by assisting in reducing CO2 emissions </li>
<li>&pound;101,000 for school cycle training</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London Boris Johnson said: 'When I was elected I promised I would be different and give greater freedom to the boroughs. </p>
<p>'This is why this year I have introduced a &pound;100,000 award for boroughs to spend as they choose.</p>
<p>'Boroughs are being given greater freedom to develop and deliver the schemes they want, which means more choice over a range of key local schemes to improve town centres and cycling facilities, tackle the school run and improve local roads.<br>&nbsp;<br>'I am awarding Ealing a budget of &pound;5.6m next year for local schemes that will make travelling safer, more accessible and more environment-friendly, helping to improve the quality of life for people across the borough.'</p>
<p>Funding for local transport schemes is allocated each year by TfL in response to the applications from boroughs based on their Local Implementation [transport] Plans (LIPs). </p>
<p>Funding is currently available for a wide range of programmes including road safety, maintaining borough roads, tackling the school run, improving walking, cycling and the local environment, making transport more accessible and measures to improve bus journeys.&nbsp; </p>
