<p>AFTER bagging the biggest medal haul for 100 years, Britain's Olympic and Paralympic athletes will take part in a heroes parade through London tomorrow.</p>

<p>The athletes, who brought home 150 medals between them, will travel on a series of floats from Mansion House to Trafalgar Square, setting off at 11am.</p>

<p>The best places to catch the parade include Great Victoria Street, Fleet Street, the Strand and Trafalgar Square, where the celebratory proceedings will finish at 2pm.</p>

<p>The closest stations to the route include Mansion House, St Paul's, City Thameslink, Blackfriars, Temple, Embankment and Charing Cross.</p>

<p>Some temporary bus diversions and roads closures will be&nbsp;in place to allow the parade to pass, so to plan your journey, visit tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner</p>

<p>Police will begin to close roads around the parade route from 10.30am, with them re-opening once the parade has passed. Organisers expect that the route will be fully open by 3pm.</p>
