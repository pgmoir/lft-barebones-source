        Passengers travelling during peak times on the Central line are now benefiting from improved services.
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Since 17 July, the number of trains operating during peak times has been increased.</p>
<p>On the eastbound Central line the number of trains per hour has increased from:</p>
<ul>
<li>24 to 27 between 8am and 9am 
</li><li>27 to 30 between 5pm and 6pm </li></ul>
<p>The morning westbound peak service has now been lengthened to operate between 7:45 am and 9:15 am. </p>
<p>The frequency of trains has been increased from 24 to 27 trains per hour between 4pm and 6pm.</p>
<p>
<h2>increased frequency</h2>
<p>
<p>General Manager of the Central line, Jeff Ellis said:"Crowding on trains and waiting times on platforms should be reduced as a direct result of the increased frequency of Central line trains and availability of spare trains in depots at Loughton and Hainault / West Ruislip.</p>
<p>"The Tube is improving, last year it carried more passengers in a single year - 976 million - than ever before. </p>
<p>"LU also ran more trains then ever before, clocking up a huge total of nearly 70m kms."</p>
<p>TfL is investing &pound;10 billion over the next five years to improve and expand London's transport network, more than half of that in the Tube.</p>
<p>The Central line is due to be further improved in 2006 when significant service changes will take place with a higher train frequency during off peak times.</p>
<p>
<h2>fully upgraded</h2>
<p>
<p>The Central line is due to be fully upgraded in 2007 by Metronet Rail BCV. </p>
<p>The aim is to provide customers travelling between Leytonstone and White City with a train every 2 minutes during peak times in each direction.</p>
<p>Peak service times will also increase to three hours (from 7am to 10am and from 4pm to 7pm).</p>
