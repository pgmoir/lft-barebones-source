        <ul>
            <li>Amy
            Nicholson honoured for bravery shown during events in Woolwich on 22 May
            2013</li>
            <li>Mark Mackenzie honoured for

        <p>Two Transport for London (TfL) employees have been recognised in
        the Queen's Birthday Honours list. </p>
        <p>One has been recognised for her selfless act
        during the horrific Woolwich murder in 2013 and one for his contribution to the
        way Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered people are treated whilst working
        on or travelling on London's transport network.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Mark
        has been awarded an MBE (Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) and Amy
        has been awarded a BEM (British Empire Medal).
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Sir
        Peter Hendy CBE, London's Transport Commissioner, said: &quot;I would like to
        congratulate Amy and Mark on this special recognition. It is well deserved and
        demonstrates the commitment and passion our staff have for each other and the
        communities they serve each day.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Amy
        Nicholson BEM, a Revenue Protection Inspector, demonstrated her bravery,
        passion and commitment to TfL and the local community during the incident in
        Woolwich on 22 May 2013. </p>
        <p>Amy had just finished her shift and was on her way
        home when traffic, including the bus she was on, came to a standstill with her
        bus stopped next to the Royal Artillery Barracks.
        &nbsp;
        Amy
        made contact with the TfL control room to understand more about the incident
        and was told there were two individuals armed with knives and guns, it was a
        highly dangerous situation and she was advised she should leave the area
        immediately.
        &nbsp;
        However,
        seeing that other bus passengers were all leaving the buses and there was no
        one stopping them from heading towards the trouble, Amy bravely and selflessly
        took control of the situation. She liaised with bus staff in the area and kept
        passengers calm. She ensured all buses were evacuated and then led passengers
        to safety beyond the police cordon.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Mark Mackenzie MBE, a HR specialist at TfL, has made a huge
        contribution to the way Lesbian,
        Gay, Bisexual and Transgendered (LGBT+) staff are treated as well as the wider
        LGBT+ community when they are travelling on London's transport network.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Mark
        is a founding member of TfL's staff network group for LGBT+ staff and, as past
        chair of the group, led support for Pride in London. During the London 2012
        Olympic and Paralympic Games, he worked as a Travel Ambassador and has been a
        champion within TfL for London's bid to host the 2018 Gay Games.
        &nbsp;
        Mark
        is also a representative for OutWest, the support group for the LGBT+ community
        in west London. He has led work with British Transport Police to reduce hate
        crime on public transport. This led to a Hate Crime Best Practice Guide for the
        force and to the monitoring and reporting of hate crime across TfL's transport
        networks.</p>
