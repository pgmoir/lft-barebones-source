<h2>Standard Life - Annuity Targeting Pension Fund</h2>


<p>This fund has a very different aim from most other investment-linked funds. It is designed for investors approaching retirement and considering annuity purchase. It aims to reduce the effect of changes in long term interest rates on the value of pension income the fund can purchase. Long term interest rates are one of the main factors affecting the cost of an annuity. The fund invests predominately in bonds whose prices are normally expected to rise and fall broadly in line with the cost of purchasing pension income. The fund does not provide any guarantees in relation to the level of pension income you will be able to purchase at retirement. It also does not protect against changes in the cost of purchasing an annuity that arise due to changes in life expectancy.</p>
<p>Please note that this fund may not be suitable for everyone, for example it may not be suitable for a customer who is not considering annuity purchase or for those who intend to buy a pension that increases each year at a rate linked with inflation.</p>

<h2>Standard Life - Deposit and Treasury Fund</h2>


<p>The fund aims to provide a return before charges equivalent to overnight deposits by investing in deposits and short term money market instruments.</p>
<p>The fund price is not guaranteed by Standard Life and there could be circumstances where the fund price may fall. A fall might happen if, for example, there is a default by one of the banks where some of the money held or where there is an adverse market movement in the value of some if the money market instruments held. A fall may also happen if interest income falls so low as to be less than the charges applied to the fund.</p>

<h2>Standard Life - Passive Plus III Pension Fund</h2>


<p>The fund aims to provide long term growth while being managed to a level of risk, rather than a level of return. This fund is risk level III and as such invests in both lower risk investments such as money market instruments and certain types of bonds, and higher risk investments such as equities and property. This may suit you if you have a balanced attitude to risk. The investments in the fund can be from around the world. The fund can also invest in absolute return funds that aim to provide positive investment returns regardless of the market.</p>

<h2>Standard Life - Ethical Pension Fund</h2>


<p>The fund aims to provide long term growth by investing in a diversified portfolio of assets (including equities and corporate bonds) that meet Standard Life's strict ethical criteria. The fund's assets can be from both the UK and overseas and are predominately equity based. The ethical criteria are agreed with the Standard Life Ethical Committee and may be amended from time to time if considered appropriate. The fund manager will exclude companies which fail to meet the ethical criteria while seeking to include companies whose business activities are regarded as making a positive contribution to society.&nbsp;</p>
