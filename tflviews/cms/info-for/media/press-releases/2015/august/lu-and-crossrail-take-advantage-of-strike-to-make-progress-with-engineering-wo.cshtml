<p>Transport staff and volunteers are once again helping London's residents, workers and visitors beat the Tube strike today, with services running on all other Transport for London (TfL) networks. Buses, trains, roads, river services and Santander Cycles have been busier than usual, but commuters adapted their journeys to get to work.</p>
<p>London Underground (LU) is taking advantage of trains not running by carrying out extra engineering work. This includes work at Walthamstow Central to get ahead of schedule with the ongoing track replacement work there. LU has also given Crossrail access to sites at locations including Liverpool Street, Bond Street and Tottenham Court Road, to carry out extra work throughout the day and night during the strike action.
</p>
<p>There are no Tube services at all today, Thursday 6 August, which is due to union leaders calling a co-ordinated period of strike action. Customers who are able to change their travel time are strongly advised to travel outside peak hours this afternoon, and all customers are advised to allow more time for their journeys.</p>
<p>Services will resume as normal tomorrow morning, Friday 7 August.</p>
<p>Staff on the DLR, London Overground, the bus network, tram and TfL Rail services are not on strike. These services are running as normal, but they are busier than usual and customers are strongly advised to, if possible, travel outside of the evening peak.</p>
<p>Steve Griffiths, London Underground's Chief Operating Officer, said: `We thank our customers for bearing with us during this unnecessary strike action. I am sorry that many people's journeys have been difficult this morning, but we are doing everything we can to get our customers around by other means. We are also taking advantage of the fact no trains are running by making progress with engineering work.</p>
<p>`The evening peak will be very busy again tonight, so we urge people to travel at other times if they can and allow a bit more time for their journeys. We have made a very fair offer to the unions that includes pay rises and bonuses for all, and guarantees to protect work-life balance. With the drivers, station staff and other roles which we have recruited for the Night Tube it is also creating over 500 jobs. We now ask them to engage properly in negotiations to get past this dispute and deliver the Night Tube that London needs. We remain ready to talk at any time.'</p>
<p>Many locations in central London are easily accessible from mainline rail stations, and TfL has hundreds of travel ambassadors on hand to help Londoners, visitors and tourists get around on foot, by bus, by Santander Cycles or by other means.  Around 250 extra buses are boosting capacity on the main commuter corridors and to and from mainline stations and additional Santander Cycles hubs mean more bikes are available at the busiest locations. Extra river services are also being provided during peak hours today. These services are very busy and customers are asked to bear with the transport staff who are at work and trying to help them get around.</p>
<p>Travel advice to customers during the strike action:</p>

<ul>
    <li>The Night Tube is part of London Underground's work to modernise the service offered to customers.</li>
    <li>It is widely supported by Londoners and businesses and will transform night time journeys across London.</li>
    <li>Journey times will be cut by an average of 20 minutes, with some cut by more than an hour.</li>
    <li>London's night-time economy will be opened up to a host of new opportunities, with the Night Tube supporting around 2,000 permanent jobs and boosting the economy by &pound;360 million.</li>
