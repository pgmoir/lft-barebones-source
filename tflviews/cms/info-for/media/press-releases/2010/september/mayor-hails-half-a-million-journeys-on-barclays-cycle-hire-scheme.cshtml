            <p>Less than six weeks since the Mayor, Barclays and Transport for London (TfL) launched London's brand new public transport system,&nbsp;more than&nbsp;80,000 people have signed up as members of the Mayor's scheme, making more than 500,000 journeys between them. </p>
<p>The popularity of the scheme means that around 18,500 journeys are now being made every weekday by Barclays Cycle Hire bikes, despite the system currently being available to members only. </p>
<h2>Commute by bike</h2>
<p>On 7 September thousands of cycle hire members used the scheme to beat the strike, making a record 24,500 journeys between them. </p>
<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said: 'It's an incredible achievement that cycle hire scheme members have already made half a million journeys, less than six weeks since the scheme launched. </p>
<p>'Our glorious blue bikes have transformed the city's streets, and are leading the charge in the two wheeled cycling revolution that is taking place in the Capital.</p>
<p>'Having a key to this scheme is just like having the keys to the city itself, and our pioneering members are embracing the scheme and the freedom it offers them in their tens of thousands.' </p>
<h2>Sign up</h2>
<p>David Brown, Managing Director of Surface Transport at TfL, said: 'With half a million cycle journeys and 80,000 members signed up, it is clear that Barclays Cycle Hire is a fantastic addition to the London transport system, which is being embraced by those who live and work in the Capital. </p>
<p>'Around 93 per cent of all journeys made by Barclays Cycle Hire members have been under 30 minutes, which means that the vast majority of people using the scheme aren't paying any more than their daily &pound;1, weekly &pound;5 or annual &pound;45 access fees.'</p>
<p>Barclays Cycle Hire is due to be opened up to casual users and visitors later this year. In the meantime, anyone who has a UK bank or credit card account can sign up to use the scheme, for as little as &pound;4 - the total cost of a membership key and an initial 24-hour membership. </p>
<p>People who sign up for a daily membership can choose to auto-renew, which means they can start a new 24-hour hire period whenever they want, by simply inserting their cycle hire key into a docking point and taking a bike. <br></p><strong>
