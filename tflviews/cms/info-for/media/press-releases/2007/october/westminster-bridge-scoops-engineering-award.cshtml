            <p>Revolutionary works to repair the Capital's oldest bridge gain recognition at industry awards. 
<p>
<p>Transport for London's (TfL's) work to replace fascias on Westminster Bridge was awarded a highly commended at the Institute of Civil Engineers London Region Merit Awards for 2007. </p>
<p>The awards, held at The Tower Hotel on Thursday 11 October, recognised innovation, engineering excellence and sustainability in the field. 
<p>Westminster Bridge is the oldest bridge still in use in London and is one of the most historic and photographed parts of the Capital. </p>
<p>TfL worked with contractor Interserve, their designer Tony Gee and Partners, and consultant Hyder, on the project.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Decorative fascias</h2>
<p>The scheme replaced 14 cast iron decorative fascias and refurbished 28 spandrels and 32 decorative shields. </p>
<p>Throughout the work the bridge and river remained open for all users and work was conducted from a 35 metre floating crane from the river. </p>
<p>This ground breaking method of working was one of the elements of the project recognised at the ICE Merit Awards.</p>
<p>TfL's Project Manager, Wole Ajose, said: '"The award reflects the hard work, commitment and ingenuity of the project team on what was a challenging and important scheme.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"We have been able to deliver this project with minimal disruption to the public and three months ahead of programme."</p>
<p>The awards were presented on the night by Mr Quentin Leiper, President of the Institution of Civil Engineers.
