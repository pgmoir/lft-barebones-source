        London Underground (LU) responded today to the RMT union's call for a ballot for strike action among its members in Metronet, and industrial action short of a strike by some of its London Underground members.

            <p>"The RMT dispute is with Metronet, not LU.</p>
<p>&quot;RMT are threatening industrial action on the Tube without first knowing the result of a ballot for strike action at Metronet.  Furthermore, they are proposing industrial action on the Tube even if LU engineers and the rail safety regulator, HMRI, say the Underground is safe.</p>
<p>&quot;RMT gave LU a deadline of 9pm on Thursday November 10 to respond to their concerns, but without waiting for that deadline, RMT have announced plans for industrial action on the Tube.</p>
<p>&quot;We understand that Metronet and the RMT are still negotiating and hope for a successful conclusion to those talks.</p>
<p>&quot;LU will continue to work to provide a safe, reliable and clean Tube service, every day.&quot;<br></p>
