        Phase Two of works to improve Brixton town centre to begin in April.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Transport for London (TfL) has awarded the contract for Phase Two of the Brixton town centre project to London-based construction company FM Conway Limited. 
<p>The project is part of the Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone's pledge to improve pedestrian facilities and the public realm in the Capital. 
<p>Phase Two of the project, to improve pedestrian and bus facilities along the A23 Brixton Road between Stockwell Road and Coldharbour Lane, is due to begin in April. 
<h2>Pleasant environment </h2>
<p>The scheme will see the footways widened, additional sections of bus lanes introduced and general street clutter removed to make the area a more pleasant environment for people. 
<p>The construction work will be carried out in stages so that the impact on local residents and commuters is minimised. 
<p>It is due to be completed in early 2009, including a two week break scheduled over the busy Christmas period so as not to impact on retailers during their peak period. 
<p>Consultation on the scheme was carried out in 2006 and work is being coordinated with London Borough of Lambeth. 
<h2>Urban environment</h2>
<p>Phase One of the Brixton Town Centre project was finished in 2005 and included improvements to pedestrian facilities and bus accessibility at Brixton Road, Stockwell Road and Stockwell Park Road. 
<p>Phase Three of the project, the creation of Brixton Central Square, will include the removal of the gyratory system around St Matthews Church and the creation of a square at Windrush Square and Tate Gardens. 
<p>This phase of the project is a part of the Mayor's 100 Public Spaces Programme and work is scheduled to commence on it in late 2008. 
<p>The Brixton town centre project is a part of TfL's &pound;10bn Investment Programme, funding work to improve London's transport system and enhance the urban environment. 
<p>The value of the contract awarded to FM Conway Limited for this phase of the Brixton project is &pound;1.3m.
