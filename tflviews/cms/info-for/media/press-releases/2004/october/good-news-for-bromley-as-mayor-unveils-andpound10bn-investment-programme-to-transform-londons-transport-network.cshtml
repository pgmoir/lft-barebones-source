<p>Speaking at City Hall, the Mayor said:</p>
<p>"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reverse decades of under-investment in Bromley and right across London. It marks an end to stop-start funding for London's transport. The programme will deliver real improvements in the services and capacity needed to keep passengers travelling in and through Bromley on the move."</p>
<p>The main benefits for Bromley included in TfL's 5 Year Investment Programme, subject to approval by the TfL Board, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the East London Line Project will be extended south to Crystal Palace, west to Croydon and north to Dalston Junction - this work will be carried out by 2010, in good time for the Olympics; 
</li><li>funding the proposed extension of Croydon Tramlink from Beckenham Junction to Crystal Palace to design and powers stage. </li></ul>
<p>The Mayor added:</p>
<p>"The last four years have seen huge improvements in Bromley's bus services. This investment programme will build on this and deliver improvements right across the transport network.</p>
<p>"We have had to take hard choices. Even with the biggest transport investment programme London has seen since the Second World War, we cannot do everything we want to do this time round. But there have been no trade-offs between maintaining the existing system or launching new projects."</p>
<p>Work undertaken to improve transport in Bromley by TfL over the past four years, benefiting all Londoners including those with disabilities and the socially excluded, includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>more reliable services and better information on all bus services; 
</li><li>licensing private hire vehicles to improve passenger safety; 
</li><li>funding for improving conditions for walking, cycling and road safety; 
</li><li>improvements in dial-a-ride and taxicard funding; 
</li><li>new low floor fully accessible buses on 35 routes, increased frequencies on 25 routes, the introduction of 5 new routes (354, 356, 363, R6, R7) and 3 night bus routes (N119, N63 and N75); </li></ul>
<p>In partnership with Bromley a range of schemes have been implemented including:</p>
<ul>
<li>improvement to the forecourt at Penge East Station and; 
</li><li>the introduction of 22 'Walking Bus' routes at 17 schools in the Borough - 300 pupils have already participated in this scheme.</li></ul>
            <ol>
<li>The Investment Programme will be formally approved by the board of TfL at a meeting on October 27th. 
</li><li>Crossrail is not part of the Programme. TfL is progressing it as a joint partnership with government in expectation of a Hybrid Bill. 
</li><li>Many of the projects listed are subject to further consultation or other statutory processes before they can be delivered, and may be delivered beyond the life of the Programme. 
</li><li>Tube Lines are responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines; 
</li><li>Metronet Rail BCV are responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria and Waterloo &amp; City lines; 
</li><li>Metronet Rail SSL are responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the Sub-Surface lines, the Circle, District, Hammersmith &amp; City, Metropolitan and East London lines.</li></ol>
