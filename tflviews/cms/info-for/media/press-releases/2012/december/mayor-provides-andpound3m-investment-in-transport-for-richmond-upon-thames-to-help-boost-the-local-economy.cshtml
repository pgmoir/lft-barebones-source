<li>Despite reduction in Transport for London's (TfL) central Government funding, investment levels maintained for the borough to deliver the Mayor's transport strategy</li>
<li>TfL to help reduce costs and co-ordinate works on the boroughs main roads to reduce impact of roadworks </li></ul>
<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced &pound;3m for Richmond upon Thames to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.</p>
<p>The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>The &pound;3m funding package in 2013/14 in Richmond will finance a range of transport projects including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;110,000 for cycle training, parking and improvements to routes for cyclists</li>
<li>&pound;277,000 to improve road safety, including the use of Speed Indication Devices (SIDs) at sites where the speed of vehicles are a concern for local residents</li>
<li>&pound;200,000 for Whitton High Street to improve the public realm and&nbsp; street environment as well as access to and from Whitton Station</li>
<li>&pound;100,000 to light footways to encourage walking and reduce the fear of crime. </li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Richmond.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'</p>
<p>This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said:&nbsp; 'We are working in partnership with Richmond and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>Last year in Richmond, it funded 62 cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 2,863 children and 244 adults, eight new accessible bus stops, for 38 schools to participate in walking events and 112 new street trees.</p>
<p>Notable larger projects undertaken in Richmond this year include improvements to Richmond Town Centre, which received &pound;1m Major Scheme funding to complete public realm improvements , including the pedestrianisation of Richmond Station forecourt and the provision of direct pedestrian crossing facilities for better links between the station and shops. </p>

<p><br><strong>Notes to Editors:</strong></p>
<p>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally. While Transport individual projects is the responsibility of each borough.</p>
