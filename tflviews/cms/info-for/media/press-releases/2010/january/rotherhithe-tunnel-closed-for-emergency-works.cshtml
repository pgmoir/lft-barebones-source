            <p>The Rotherhithe Tunnel will remain closed until Wednesday morning to allow Transport for London (TfL) to undertake emergency works. </p>
<p>The works are taking place to ensure the safety of the vehicles and pedestrians who use the tunnel, after tiles came loose and fell in the tunnel earlier today</p>
<p>TfL engineers have been working throughout the day to assess and replace the tiles, some of which have fallen from the tunnel lining and currently pose a safety hazard. </p>
<p>In order to complete the work as quickly as possible, the tunnel is likely to remain closed until 05.00 on Wednesday 13 January.</p>
<p>Garrett Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer, London Streets, said:&nbsp;'TfL engineers are working to reopen the tunnel as quickly as possible and we apologise for any inconvenience caused due to these works.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'We are advising drivers to use alternative river crossings and allow extra time for their journey. </p>
<p>'We would also ask people to consider using the Tube or the DLR while the tunnel is closed to cross the river.'</p>
