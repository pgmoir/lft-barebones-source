        <p>Transport
        for London (TfL) has appointed TateHindle as
        the architect to prepare the planning
        proposals for the redevelopment of its historic London Underground
        Headquarters, 55 Broadway. </p>
        <p>In August 2013, TfL launched a competitive tender
        for architects to submit their proposals for the future of the building.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>During
        the tender process, TfL considered every potential option for the building with
        office, hotel and residential uses all being evaluated. </p>
        <p>After detailed analysis
        the conclusion was reached that a residential led development would deliver the
        best value for fare and taxpayers and would also be the most suitable option to
        maintain the heritage of the Grade I listed building.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Graeme
        Craig, Director of Commercial Development at TfL, said: &quot;We're pleased to
        announce that TateHindle has been appointed as
        the architect to take the planning process forward for 55 Broadway.&nbsp; We
        recognise the historic value of the building and the need to carefully ensure
        that any future use enhances the building's historic features.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>&quot;We
        remain committed to securing a future for the building that ensures it remains
        a valued part of the fabric of London. We also have a responsibility to fare
        and taxpayers to make sure that any redevelopment of 55 Broadway is a
        commercial success, with all proceeds reinvested in London's transport network
        to deliver increased and improved services.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>TfL
        will be working closely with TateHindle and
        will be leading on the planning application and the listed building approval
        process, rather than engaging with an external developer at this stage. </p>
        <p>TfL
        expects to submit the planning application in autumn 2014.&nbsp;
        In the meantime, the building will continue to be used as an office for
        TfL staff with plans for staff to remain there until 2015.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Andrew Tate,
        Director of TateHindle, said: &quot;We are delighted to have won this important
        commission to work in collaboration with TfL on the 55 Broadway project. Our
        design objective is to breathe new life into the building with a particular
        focus on enhancing it's setting, whilst remaining respectful of its cultural
        heritage and architectural integrity.&quot;
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Designed
        by Charles Holden and built between 1927 and 1929, 55 Broadway has been London
        Underground's iconic Headquarters for over 80 years and is situated above St
        James's Park Tube station. The building was listed Grade II in 1970 and
        upgraded to Grade I in 2011 by English Heritage on account of its outstanding
        national historic and architectural interest.&nbsp;

            <li>The appointment of TateHindle follows a Competitive Dialogue Procurement Process under OJEU
            (Official Journal of European Union)</li>
            <li>London Underground owns the freehold interest in 55
            Broadway, 100 Petty France and the Wing over Station (&quot;the Buildings&quot;) and
            holds a long occupational lease of Albany House. 55 Broadway is a Grade I
            Listed Building which lies within the Broadway &amp; Christchurch Gardens
            Conservation Area</li>
            <li>The
            building was commissioned in the 1920s by The Underground Group who wanted
            Broadway to reflect its bold vision of the future of transport in London.
            Architects Adams, Holden and Pearson were given the task of creating a
            groundbreaking design</li>
            <li>The
            site at St James's Park Tube station was challenging because of its irregular
            shape and the District and Circle line only 7.3 metres below. The solution was
            a cross-shaped layout, allowing pedestrians to walk through the ground floor of
            the offices, across the station booking hall, providing a short cut between
            Victoria Street and St James's Park</li>
            <li>Above
            ground, the building was faced with 78,000 cubic feet of high quality Portland
            stone. Contemporary artists were invited to sculpt decorative features into the
            stone facade, carved on site. Two are just above street level and a further
            eight are above the sixth floor windows on each side of all four wings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The
        sculptors were: </p>

            Epstein</li>

            <li>The
            Royal Institute of British Architects awarded 55 Broadway its 1929 London
            Architectural Medal</li>
            <li>
            During
            WW2 the west wing received considerable damage as a result of bombing. It was
            rebuilt - without Portland stone facing which was not available at the
            time. The Portland stone was reinstated in 1963</li>
            <li>55
            Broadway was refurbished in the 1980s. The exterior stone work was cleaned, the
            windows replaced with exact replicas, and a new street-level shopping mall
            allowed the reopening of the eastern entrance to the building</li>
