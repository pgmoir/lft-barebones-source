            <p>The works are undertaken by Metronet Rail BCV, the company in charge of the maintenance and renewal of the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria and Waterloo &amp; City lines.</p>
<p>Passengers will not be affected by the works as the station will remain open whilst it is being refurbished.</p>
<p>However, advantage will be taken of track closures affecting Loughton to undertake weekend work.</p>
<p>Refurbishment works will include: the restoration of heritage features; the replacement of all CCTV cameras; the installation of customer help points; an enhanced public address system and tactile strips on platforms and contrasting handrails for the partially sighted.</p>
<p>All cabling will now not be visible to the public and ceilings will be either replaced or decorated.</p>
