        As a partner of ExCeL London, the Emirates Air Line now offers event visitors and exhibitors the opportunity to arrive in style for an exclusive &pound;2.50 per journey rate (normal fare is &pound;4.50).

    <p>Why not travel home or to your event with a unique flight on the Emirates Air Line. The cable car connects Royal Victoria (DLR) station and North Greenwich (Jubilee Line). Royal Victoria is just a short walk from ExCeL.</p>
From North Greenwich, Canary Wharf is just one stop away and getting to and from Central London takes only 15 minutes.
<p>Journey times on the cable car are under 10 minutes. Visitors can access The O2 in North Greenwich easily for entertainment after the event day and choose from a selection of bars and restaurants, all while soaking up city skyline views.</p>
<p>Whether you are on your way to an event or finishing up the day, you can benefit from a discounted trip at just &pound;2.50.</p>
<p>To redeem the discounted rate, show proof of attendance to an ExCeL event on the day (for example, a ticket, delegate pass or confirmation email showing the same day of travel).</p>
<ul>
    <li>Cabins  arrive every 30 seconds and flights last approximately 10 minutes each way</li>
    <li>Fully accessible for wheelchairs, bicycles and pushchairs with step-free access</li>
