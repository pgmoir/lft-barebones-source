<p>Although the Trustees provide a facility for members of the Fund to pay AVCs it is a separate and personal arrangement between the individual and the AVC provider.
</p>
<p>AVCs are paid into a personal fund and used to provide additional pension benefits on retirement.</p>
<h2>Who can pay</h2>
<p>The majority of active members of the Fund are eligible. However you will not be able to pay AVCs if you are planning to retire within a year of commencing AVCs.</p>
<h2>Payment amounts</h2>
<p>If you joined the pension scheme after 1 June 1989, you can pay up to 15% of your gross taxable earnings (subject to the Scheme Earnings Cap) in each tax year, minus your normal contributions to the Fund.</p>
<p>If you joined the Fund before 1 June 1989, you can pay up to 15% of your gross taxable earnings, minus your normal contributions.</p>
<p>You can change the amount you pay by contacting the Fund office.</p>
<h2>Making payments</h2>
<p>Your contributions are deducted from your pay by your employer. You can also make one-off payments.</p>
<p>You can stop payments by giving four weeks' notice.</p>
<h2>AVC investment</h2>
<p>Your AVCs are invested according to your choice. <a href="/pensions/your-pension/your-contributions/avc-investment-options">Read about the investment options</a>.</p>
<h2>AVC tax advantages</h2>
<p>Just like your main Fund contributions you get full tax relief on your AVCs. Investment returns on your AVC fund are free of income tax.</p>
<h2>Transferring your AVCs</h2>
<p>You can transfer your AVCs at any time before or after leaving service and drawing your benefits from the Fund.</p>
<h2>AVCs on retiring</h2>
<p>You may take up to 25% of the value of your total benefits from the Fund as a tax-free lump sum when you retire. If your AVCs exceed this amount the balance must be used to buy you a pension from an insurer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may choose to use all or part of your AVCs to buy an annuity or defer payment.</p>
<p>From April 2015 the Government introduced new flexibilities for those drawing benefits from defined contribution pension savings; these additional flexibilities are not available under the TfL AVC plan, however you can benefit from these flexibilities if you transfer your AVCs to an individual arrangement.  </p>
<p>The Government have set up services to provide free, impartial money advice. Visit <a href="https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk">https://www.pensionwise.gov.uk</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk">https://www.moneyadviceservice.org.uk</a> for further details about the services provided and how to access them.</p>
<h2>In case of death</h2>
<p>Subject to HMRC limits, your AVC fund may be payable as a tax-free lump sum at the discretion of the Fund's Trustees.  Payment would normally be to the recipients of the lump sum death benefit.</p>
<h2>Deferring payments of AVC benefits</h2>
<p>Your AVCs will remain in the TfL Pension Fund AVC Plan until you decide to take them.</p>
<ul>
    <li>    They will continue to be invested in accordance with your investment choices</li>
    <li>    During the deferred period you can change your investments between the various funds offered</li>
    <li>    You will continue to receive annual benefit statements confirming the value of your AVCs</li>
    <li>    You must start drawing an income from your AVCs by the time you reach age 75, otherwise your AVCs will then be automatically used to buy an annuity</li>
    <li>    Only 25% of the fund value at the time you take your AVCs may be taken as cash with the rest used to buy you an annuity with an insurer</li>
</ul>
<h2>AVC annuities</h2>
<p>You can get quotations from the Fund's appointed AVC providers or from other insurance companies to assess which offers the best value.</p>
<p>If you decide to get quotes from other insurance companies you should contact them direct.</p>
<p>To help you, you could visit the Financial Services Authority's website at <a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/">http://www.fsa.gov.uk/</a> and get instant quotes from a number of insurers. Alternatively you could contact the Annuity Bureau on 0845 602 6263.</p>
