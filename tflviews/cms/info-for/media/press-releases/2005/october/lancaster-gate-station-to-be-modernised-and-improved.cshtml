            <p>The works - which will be undertaken by Metronet Rail BCV, the company responsible for the maintenance and renewal of the Bakerloo, Central, Victoria and Waterloo & City lines - will commence in November 2005 and are due to be completed in November 2006.</p>
<p>Disruptions to commuters will be kept to a minimum as most of the modernisation works will take place when the Tube is closed.</p>
<p>However, London Underground is currently considering a request from Metronet Rail BCV to close the station for a period of three months in Summer 2006. <br> <br>Modernisation works will include the building of a new station control room, the restoration of heritage features, the replacement of all CCTV cameras, the installation of new information display panels, customer help points, new signage, an enhanced public address system, tactile strips and contrasting handrails for the partially sighted. </p>
<p>All cabling will be concealed and ceilings will be either replaced or decorated.<br><br></p>
