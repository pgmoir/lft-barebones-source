        Metrobus drivers not to go on strike.

 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>Metrobus drivers will not be taking part in strike action on Friday 10 October 2008.</p>
<p>Bus drivers belonging to the Unite union at First and Metroline may still go on a 24-hour strike from 03:00 tomorrow over the 2008 pay settlement.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This strike action could potentially affect 162 bus routes, or up to a quarter of the Capital's bus network.</p>
<p>TfL is working to keep passenger disruption to a minimum, and we would ask that passengers check their route and listen to media travel updates before they travel on Friday.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Where possible, we would advise passengers to use alternative means of transport.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Passenger information will be provided by TfL through a number of channels:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Countdown </strong>- a message will be displayed on Countdown signs at affected bus stops from this afternoon (Thursday 9 October) to give passengers advance warning of the strike, and will be displayed all day on Friday</li>
<li><strong>Publicity </strong>- London Buses has been posting signs at bus stops, shelters and stations from Wednesday 8 October</li>
<li><strong>Travel information </strong>- customers can contact our travel information team by phone on 020 7222 1234 for up-to-date information and advice on alternative means of transport.&nbsp;As lines are likely to be busy, we advise customers&nbsp;to check <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/livetravelnews">real-time travel information </a>or visit <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/journeyplanner">Journey Planner </a></li>
<li><strong>Additional staff </strong>- extra staff members will be out on the network during the strikes, concentrating on the busiest stations and stops, to offer advice and guidance to passengers.&nbsp;Where possible, staff will be driving along bus routes with no service to offer advice to passengers </li></ul>

<p>If this strike action goes ahead, we know Londoners will face a frustrating day on Friday.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Those bus drivers and other public transport workers that have come to work will be doing their very best to keep London moving.&nbsp; </p>

<p>We would ask for passengers' patience in what may be a difficult journey.</p>
