<p>The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson has today announced &pound;4.4m for Bexley to invest in transport projects that will benefit the local community.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>TfL has allocated the money through Local Implementation Plan (LIP) funding for the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy.</p>
<p>The funding is awarded to support projects in the London boroughs that will make cycling safer and easier, improve walking facilities, make roads safer, smooth traffic flow and breathe new life into town centres, public squares and local shopping areas to boost the local economy.</p>
<p>The &pound;4.4m funding package in 2013/14 will finance a range of transport projects in Bexley including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;690,000 for Welling Corridor to improve the public realm and other infrastructure improvements on the A207 corridor between Crook Log and the borough boundary with Greenwich</li>
<li>&pound;476,000 for local safety schemes. The funds will be used to assess collision records and identify and develop measures to reduce accidents</li>
<li>&pound;210,000 for public realm and junction improvements on Bourne Road and London Road to create a gateway to Crayford</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said:&nbsp;'This funding will benefit all of London and everyone living in, working in or visiting Bexley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>'A world class city deserves a world class transport system and the borough will use this money to make significant improvements for local people.'</p>
<p>This year, two new measures have been introduced which will help the boroughs to drive down their costs, deliver value for money and minimise the disruption caused by construction works and road maintenance.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Boroughs can use the new London Highways Alliance Contracts (LoHAC) to avoid the need for each authority to separately appoint contractors to undertake works.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Local investment</h2>
<p>These are four area-based joint highway contracts awarded in November by TfL and the boroughs to reduce costs, provide consistency in the quality of works and materials and to minimise disruption.</p>
<p>In addition, projects undertaken on main roads in the boroughs will be co-ordinated by TfL so that the method and timing of roadworks is managed to reduce their impact in the Capital and associated inconvenience and disruption to residents and road users. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE said: 'We are working in partnership with Bexley and with all the London boroughs to bring real improvements to communities across the city.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'The borough will be using this investment to fund hundreds of projects that will benefit all road users, including cyclists and pedestrians.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Public squares and local shopping areas will be rejuvenated, attracting more people to the area to boost the local economy.'</p>
<p>Last year in Bexley, it financed cycle training for 918 children and 22 adults, enabled 40 schools to participate in walking events and 10 in cycling events and the planting of 320 new street trees.</p>
<p>Notable larger projects undertaken in Bexley this year include completion of public realm improvements at Sidcup, which received &pound;400,000 for improvements on the High Street and Main Road for all road users.</p><strong>

<p>Notes to editors:</strong><p>
<p>Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp; </p>
<p>While individual transport projects are the responsibility of each borough.</p>
