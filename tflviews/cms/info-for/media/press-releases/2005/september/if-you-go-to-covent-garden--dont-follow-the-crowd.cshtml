<p>That's the message in a new campaign being launched by Transport for London tomorrow.</p>
<p>The campaign, including a new leaflet, will encourage visitors to London to use all modes of transport and shows the quickest walking routes to Covent Garden from Holborn, Charing Cross and Embankment. </p>
<p>Covent Garden station is the most heavily used deep-level station served solely by lifts on the Tube network and is often congested.</p>
<p>Richard Parry, London Underground's Director of Strategy &amp; Service Development, said: "We have been working very closely with Westminster and Camden councils, and local businesses, over a period of time to encourage visitors to discover all parts of Covent Garden and the neighbouring areas.<br><br><br>"We know Covent Garden station can often become very busy and many visitors are unaware of the other travel options.</p>
<p>"Our new campaign promotes alternative ways to get to Covent Garden just as quickly and will also help people to explore the area. </p>
<p><br>"Charing Cross, Embankment, Holborn, Temple and Leicester Square Tube stations, as well as numerous bus routes, are only a few minutes' walk away.</p>
<p>"The leaflet highlights nearby neighbourhoods and explains that if you travel in from Holborn Station, within five minutes you'll be strolling along historic cobbled streets lined with an eclectic mix of specialist outlets and cutting edge boutiques, with everything from designer fashion to kites.</p>
<p>"Or by getting out at Embankment Station or off a river boat at Festival Pier you'll soon be in Garrick Street, home to the famous Garrick Club and to some of the finest architecture in Covent Garden.<br><br>"Or you can jump on a bus to the Strand and you'll be in the heart of Theatreland in just a few minutes. </p>
<p>"Whether you're looking for world-class opera or ballet, the latest hit musical or a fringe theatre production, you'll find it all in Covent Garden."<br><br>The leaflet, which is available at Tube stations and tourist information centres, has walking routes to help visitors to discover some of the hidden treasures Covent Garden has to offer as well as maps, showing theatres, museums, galleries, as well as bus routes, stations and piers.<br><br></p>
