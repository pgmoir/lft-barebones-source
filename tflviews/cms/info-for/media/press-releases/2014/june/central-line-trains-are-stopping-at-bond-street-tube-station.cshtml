        <ul>
            <li>Central line passengers can get to and from the West End
            via Bond Street station again</li>
            <li>Part of over &pound;10 billion continuous improvement of London
            Underground services</li>
            <li>Key West End station will be hugely enlarged to
            accommodate more shoppers and businesses from 2017</li>
            <li>Modernised station will provide interchange with
            Crossrail to cope with an increase of passengers to nearly a quarter of a
            million daily</li>
            <li>New escalators and new lifts will provide disabled
            passengers with step-free access from street to platform
            &middot; </li>
            <li>Work to deliver this transformation means Jubilee line
            trains will not stop at Bond Street station from 30 June until early December </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Central
        line services resume at Bond Street station from today, following the
        completion of a key stage of works that will help to deliver a bigger, better
        and more modern station for customers.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        lift shaft enabling works affecting the Central line platforms have been
        completed, the lift shaft will now continue to be constructed behind hoardings
        without affecting passengers. </p>
        <p>This is part of London Underground's&nbsp;&pound;10
        billion programme of continuous improvement, major construction work will
        modernise and enlarge the station by 2017,&nbsp;allowing&nbsp;for the expected
        increase from 155,000 to 225,000 daily passengers at Bond Street station when Crossrail arrives the following year. </p>
        <p>The improvements are
        part of Transport for London's (TfL's) overall transport vision for the West
        End as it prepares to welcome more Tube customers and the arrival of Crossrail,
        with major expansion also taking place at Tottenham Court Road station.
        </p>
        <p>Customers will get their first look at brand new parts of Tottenham Court Road
        station by early 2015, when new access opens to the Northern line platforms.
        </p>
        <p>This includes a new entrance, with a second entrance opening later in 2015, a
        large part of the new ticket hall and escalators leading down to new pedestrian
        passages.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Customers
        will also benefit from quicker and easier journeys as Bond Street station is
        radically improved, with a new ticket hall and a new station entrance on the
        north side of Oxford Street.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>New
        lifts will make the station step free from
        street to platform, and new escalators are being fitted to handle the
        increasing number of customers who are using the station as we move toward the
        introduction of Crossrail.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        modernised Tube station will interchange with the new Crossrail station,
        enabling customers to access the network via entrances on Hanover Square and
        Davies Street.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>While
        escalators are inaccessible as work is being carried out to connect the new
        ticket hall to existing station infrastructure, Jubilee line trains will not
        stop at Bond Street station from 30 June until early December 2014. The station
        will operate on an exit-only basis until the end of 2014 to facilitate further
        tunnelling works.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        When
        Jubilee line trains are not stopping at Bond Street, passengers can change to
        the Bakerloo line at Baker Street, or to the Victoria line at Green Park, and
        travel to Oxford Circus. Alternatively, local buses to the Bond Street area are
        available from both Baker Street and Green Park.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>David
        Waboso CBE, London Underground's Capital Programmes Director, said: &quot;Bond
        Street station, at the heart of the West End, is
        already a major destination and passenger numbers will rise even further when
        Crossrail services begin. We're therefore transforming the Tube station &#45; with
        a new ticket hall, new entrance and step-free access amongst other
        improvements.&nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        &quot;Central
        line trains are stopping at Bond Street station again, but in order to carry
        out this vital work Jubilee line trains will not be able to&nbsp;stop there
        between Monday 30 June and early December. I apologise for the inconvenience
        that this will cause, but unfortunately it's impossible to do this work solely
        during the few engineering hours when the Tube is closed. The end result will
        be a much bigger and better station for the hundreds of thousands of customers
        who use the station each day.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Richard
        Dickinson, CEO of New West End Company said, "As a key underground station
        in London's West End, the improvements to Bond Street Tube station will provide
        one of the most important access routes to the area, further enhancing the
        visitor experience in what is one of the world's most renowned luxury shopping
        districts. TfL's plans for Crossrail provide a real opportunity for both
        shoppers and businesses in the area, and we're pleased to hear progress has
        been made so that the Central line will be open for shoppers and visitors for
        the summer months.&quot;
        &nbsp;
