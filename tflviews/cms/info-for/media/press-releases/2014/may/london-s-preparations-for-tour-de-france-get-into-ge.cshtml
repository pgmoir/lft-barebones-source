        The world's largest annual sporting event returns to London on Monday 7 July 
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">

        <p>With
        just over a month to go, London is marking the return of the Tour de France
        with a 'F&ecirc;te du Tour' - a day of simultaneous celebrations of cycling in host
        cities and towns along the whole route of the world's largest annual sporting
        event.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Festivities
        will be held at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park (QEOP) as well as across
        Yorkshire, Cambridge, Essex and throughout France. </p>
        <p>The activities will include
        a road show for cyclists of all abilities, mountain bike displays, bike
        security marking, French food stalls and official Tour de France merchandise
        available to buy.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>An
        extensive programme of public engagement&nbsp;and communication around the
        arrival of the Tour de France in the capital is now underway similar to that
        developed during the London 2012 Olympics, to help businesses and the public plan and get
        around on the day and make the most of the return of the prestigious event.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>From today maps showing the areas inside the M25 that
        will be affected by the race are available at tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance, along
        with a range of advice.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Road
        closures for the event will begin after the morning
        peak at 10:00, with roads reopening as quickly as possible once the Tour has
        passed through and it is safe to do so. </p>
        <p>TfL anticipates that all roads will be
        reopened by 18:00. Tower, Southwark and Westminster Bridges will be closed for
        much of the day but there are no planned closures on any other major river
        crossings in Central London. Pedestrians will be able to cross the route at key
        crossing points and we are working with local businesses close to the route to
        ensure that disruption is kept to a minimum. Tube and rail services will be the
        best way to get around London on the day.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>Stations along the route, and
        particularly at the Finish on The Mall, are, of course, expected to be very
        busy.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        Leaflet
        drops to residents and businesses along the route are being carried out, and
        TfL and partners are working with the local boroughs and businesses and hosting
        public information sessions to ensure that everyone who wants to can enjoy the
        event and Londoners can plan their journeys and continue to get around the city
        on the day.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Garrett
        Emmerson, Chief Operating Officer of Surface Transport at TfL, said: &quot;We've
        been working long and hard to plan for this great event's return to the capital
        and now we are asking Londoners to start their planning too.
        &nbsp;
        "We will keep the capital moving, and roads around the race
        route will, of course, be extremely busy.&nbsp; So we're asking people to plan
        ahead and preferably use public transport to make the most of what I'm sure
        will be an amazing day that will help cement London's growing reputation as a
        major cycling city and encourage more Londoners to travel by bike.&quot; </p>
        <p>The Tour de
        France &#45; the world's largest annual sporting event &#45; comes to London on Monday
        7 July after two stages in Yorkshire. </p>
        <p>Around 200 elite cyclists will travel
        from Cambridge, through Essex, into London before a spectacular finish on The
        Mall. The iconic Tour de France will draw people onto the streets of London
        from near and far, and help to inspire more people to take up cycling. </p>
        <p>Hosting
        world renowned events such as the Tour reinforces London's reputation as a
        world-class host of cultural, sporting and business events. </p>
        <p>Visitors, both
        domestic and overseas, are brought to the capital by major events, delivering
        direct and indirect economic benefits, and showcasing London to a much wider
        audience.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>There
        will be a range of ways for Londoners and visitors to get into the spirit of
        the event. QEOP will play a major role in the Tour when spectators will be able
        to watch the elite cycling action in the official Tour de France Fan Parks. In
        addition to QEOP, there will be Fan Parks sites at Green Park and Trafalgar
        Square. </p>
        <p>The Fan Park sites will feature a wide range of different activities
        and live Tour de France racing on a big screen.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The
            detailed Tour de France route is available on the TfL website at
            tfl.gov.uk/tourdefrance. To avoid delays drivers are advised to, wherever
            possible, avoid areas&nbsp;near the event routes in the affected parts of
            Cambridgeshire, Essex and London. For up to date information on how transport
            services are operating, Londoners are advised to check before they travel at
            tfl.gov.uk and follow &#64;TfLTravelAlerts (Tube, DLR and London Overground),
            &#64;TfLTrafficNews (roads) and &#64;TfLBusAlerts (buses)</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France will kick off a spectacular summer of cycling in London, with
            the exciting event followed by Prudential RideLondon on the 9 and 10 August and
            then the Tour of Britain, which finishes in the capital on 14 September</li>
            <li>The
            Tour de France is the world's largest annual sporting event and covers
            approximately 3,500kms. A worldwide television audience of 3.5billion people
            watch the event annually. There will be 190 countries broadcasting the Tour de
            France and there are 5,000 hours of TV coverage annually. The last time the
            Tour visited England was in 2007 when London hosted the Grand D&eacute;part,
            which is the opening of the race</li>
            <li>This
            summer's cycling events are likely to inspire thousands more Londoners to take
            to two wheels, building on the Mayor's ambition for cycling to be an integral
            part of the transport network. As part of his cycling vision, the Mayor is
            already engaging in a vast &pound;1billion programme of improvements&nbsp; - creating
            a series of enhanced cycling superhighways, urban 'quietways' for more cautious
            cyclists, and turning some outer boroughs into mini-Hollands</li>
            <li>For more information on the Mayor's Vision for Cycling
            visit http://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/about-tfl/how-we-work/planning-for-the-future/vision-for-cycling</li>
            <li>Pedestrians
            and cyclists will be able to cross the route at designated crossings, where
            marshals will ensure safety of all. Once the roads close, cyclists will not be
            able to ride on the route roads</li>
            <li>The
            Mayor is committed to ensuring London retains its status as the world capital
            of sport, and has set up the Major Events Oversight Board. The board is chaired
            by Sir Edward Lister, and comprises of TfL, the emergency services and other
            key partner agencies. It provides strategic direction and advice to the Mayor
            on the approach to bidding, staging and evaluating major events in London. The
            board ensures that all major road events continue to be carefully considered
            and tightly managed to ensure everyone gets full benefit from the event without
            undue impact on Londoners and London's transport. The board also looks at ways
            to ensure the major events programme is effectively communicated with
            Londoners, visitors, businesses and stakeholders to allow sufficient notice and
            forward planning for everyone. Events like these appeal to Londoners, bring in
            domestic and overseas visitors and, through media coverage, showcase London to
            a much wider audience across the world. They
            deliver direct and indirect economic benefits. Prudential RideLondon 2013
            delivered &pound;13m spend in its first year.</li>
