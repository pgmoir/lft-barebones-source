        <p>A witness statement is not a representation or complaint. It is an application to the Traffic Enforcement Centre (TEC) to ask them to revoke the registration of the penalty charge (the Order for Recovery) on one of the grounds listed below.  It does not cancel the penalty charge.  </p>
        
      </div>
    
    
      <p>
A witness statement can be made after we have issued you with an Order for Recovery.
</p>
<p>You may only make a witness statement if one of the
following grounds applies to you: </p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>You paid the penalty charge in full within 28 days<br />
    </strong>You must provide details of the date payment was made, the method of payment i.e. cash, cheque etc and who the payment was made to. Please note you may be asked to provide proof of payment upon receipt.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
    <li><strong>You did not receive the Notice to Owner or Penalty Charge Notice (PCN)</strong><br />
    This does not apply if you just forgot to pay the penalty charge,
    mislaid it or forgot to make a representation. If you did not receive the
    original Notice to Owner or PCN because you moved address,
    ensure your witness statement includes details of your new address. </li>
    <li><strong>You made a representation to us but did not receive a reply within 28
    days (rejection notice)</strong>
    <br />
    This only applies if you made a representation within the time limit to
    the correct address as provided on the PCN and did not receive a response from
    us. It does not apply if you received a reply you disagreed with or if we
    refused to consider your representation because it was late. </li>
    <li><strong>You appealed to London Tribunals within 28
    days of our decision to reject your representation, but you had no response
    to your appeal
    </strong><br />
    As above, this does not apply if you received a response but disagreed
    with it. </li>
</ul>
<p>You must file the witness statement by the date
shown on the Order for Recovery.
</p>
<p>Remember the TEC may refuse your witness statement, if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>It is not signed, or</li>
    <li>It is submitted outside the required timeframe, or</li>
    <li>It is not made on only one of the four grounds detailed above</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not send your witness statement to us but
to the TEC (they will only deal with witness statements and cannot advise you
on any other matters or take payment).
</p>
<p>Remember, the witness statement is not a chance to
complain or challenge the reason why the PCN was issued.</p>
<p>Proceedings for contempt of court may be brought
against you if you make or cause to be made a false statement, verified by a
statement of truth, without an honest belief in its truth. </p>
