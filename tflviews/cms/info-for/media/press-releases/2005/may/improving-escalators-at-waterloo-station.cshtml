<p>Tube Lines will be managing this complex work and rigorously testing the escalators. </p>
<p>While this is carried out passengers should use the following routes when interchanging between the Tube, National Rail or Eurostar services:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Waterloo &amp; City</strong> <strong>line</strong> customers - exit at the front end of the platform and use exit 7 for connection with National Rail 
</li><li><strong>Bakerloo &amp; Northern</strong> <strong>line</strong> customers - use either entrance 6 (out to York Road) or entrance 7 (which comes up in the National Rail concourse near platform 7) 
</li><li><strong>Jubilee line </strong>customers - use the entrance by McDonald's or entrance 7 
</li><li><strong>South West Trains</strong> customers - use either entrance 6 or 7 depending on which Underground line is required 
</li><li><strong>Eurostar </strong>customers - change between Waterloo terminal and Underground as normal 
</li><li><strong>Southern &amp; South Eastern Train</strong> Customers travelling via Waterloo East - connect with Jubilee line services at Southwark</li></ul>
<p>Kevin Bootle, London Underground's Jubilee line Manager, said: "Over 64 million people use Waterloo Underground station every year and that number is rising, so it is essential that these escalators are refurbished.</p>
<p>"If only one escalator had been closed at a time, the work would have taken much longer - well over a year. </p>
<p>"Escalator machine rooms are extremely small and engineers cannot work next to a moving escalator for safety reasons.</p>
<p><strong>
<h2>'Greater operational flexibility'</h2></strong>
<p>
<p>"With just two escalators working, passengers would be reluctant to find an alternative route. </p>
<p>"It would put an enormous strain on those two escalators, which would struggle to cope with the number of people using them.</p>
<p>"This essential work is part of TfL's &pound;10-billion investment over the next five years to improve and expand the capital's transport network. </p>
<p>"Although there will be some inconvenience, all the rail and Tube services are still accessible.</p>
<p>"Once the work is completed the three escalators will be fully reversible, which will allow far greater operational flexibility than before."</p>
