        The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, has today announced more than &pound;4.6m for transport improvements in Hillingdon.
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The funding has been allocated by Transport for London (TfL) through the Local Implementation Plan (LIP) process and is awarded to the borough to spend on projects that support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including safer roads, smoothing traffic flow, rejuvenating town centres and better facilities for cycling and walking. </p>
<p>The &pound;4.6m funding package in 2012/13 will finance a range of transport projects in Hillingdon, including:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;966,000 for the Yiewsley and West Drayton Town Centre Major Scheme, which will improve the shopping environment and the urban realm, reduce traffic congestion and improve bus flow and open up pedestrian and cycle routes </li>
<li>&pound;410,000 for road safety measures close to several primary schools across the borough </li>
<li>&pound;133,000 to provide pedestrian improvements along the whole of the towpath of the Grand Union Canal.&nbsp;This will support local initiatives to maintain a positive environment on the towpath while encouraging walking and cycling. The scheme will also develop new links between Bucks University and Uxbridge Town Centre </li>
<li>&pound;60,000 to introduce Legible London way finding signs in West Drayton, Ruislip Manor, Northwood Hills, Hayes and other town centres</li></ul>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'London is undergoing a neo-Victorian level of investment in its transport network.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'Every London borough is receiving money that will directly benefit communities, making London an even better place to live and work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'We've also cut bureaucracy to make it easier for the boroughs to decide how they want to spend their funding.'</p>
<p>The LIP funds hundreds of large- and small-scale transport projects every year.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Last year in Hillingdon it financed 20 new cycle parking spaces, cycle training for 676 children and 112 adults, five 20mph zones, 13 improved pedestrian crossings, 17 new accessible bus stops, 62 schools to participate in walking events and 100 in cycling events, 23 new off-street electric vehicle charging points and 388 new street trees.</p>
<p>Notable larger projects already undertaken in Hillingdon using LIP support include the &pound;268,000 Eastcote Station Access project which introduced new puffin crossing facilities, an improved public plaza outside the station, more accessible bus stops, and better facilities for cyclists and pedestrians.</p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: 'Year on year the boroughs continue to deliver innovative projects that support the Mayor's vision for transport in the Capital.&nbsp; </p>
<p>'This investment will build on the excellent work that has already been achieved and complement the huge programme of work we at TfL are undertaking to make his vision a reality through working in partnership with the boroughs.'</p>
<p>The funding was previously forecast to reduce year on year to reflect the reduced general grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, because of the importance of the boroughs in delivering the priorities of Mayor's Transport Strategy, the funding has been kept at a consistent level to 2013/14. </p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each borough produces a LIP to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp;While TfL allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough </li>
<li>A detailed breakdown of funding for bridge strengthening projects (&pound;5.3m), which will be allocated to the bridges in most need of work will be announced in the New Year </li>
<li>&nbsp;Total allocation by programme area:</li></ul>
