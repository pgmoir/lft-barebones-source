<p>Day eleven of the Games sees another packed day of cultural and sporting Olympic events, including the men's Triathlon in Hyde Park, with some roads in the area closed or with restricted access while the event takes place. </p>
<p>There are a number of events taking place at the Stratford site, with Victoria Pendleton looking to add to Team GB's cycling gold tally at the Velodrome in the women's Sprint, triple jumper Philips Idowu begins his quest for Olympic gold, as well as a host of other events including a full day of hockey at the Riverbank Arena.  </p>
<p>The area around the Olympic Park and other Games venues will be exceptionally busy and people should plan ahead to avoid disruption. </p>
<p>The Jubilee line will be very busy, particularly in the early evening from 16:00 to 20:00, as events are taking place at Wembley, North Greenwich Arena, Greenwich Park, Excel and the Olympic Park. </p>
<p>Baker Street, King's Cross and Green Park stations are expected to be very busy with spectators going to and from Wembley Stadium, where the Men's Football semi-final match between Mexico and Japan will be taking place. </p>
<p>Where possible avoid these stations at the busiest times.</p>
<p>Men's Beach Volleyball is being held at Horse Guards Parade so central London will also be busy.  </p>
<p>Volleyball at Earl's Court means the station will through the afternoon and evening. </p>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy CBE, said: 'As the second week of events take place across the Capital we have seen records broken in both sport and people using public transport.  </p>
<p>'Around 4.4m passengers were carried on the Tube on Friday 3 August so it's important that Londoners continue to plan their journeys and avoid the busiest stations at the busiest times. </p>
<p>'I would like to thank our passengers for taking our advice on board and helping us to support a great Games and a great summer in London.'</p>
