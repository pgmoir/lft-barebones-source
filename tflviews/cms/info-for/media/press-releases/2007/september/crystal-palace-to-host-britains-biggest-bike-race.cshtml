Londoners have a second chance to experience the thrill of seeing the world's top cyclists racing on London's streets
</p>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<p>A 2.5km time trial in Crystal Palace park will kick off this year's Tour of Britain.  </p>
<p>The UK's biggest cycle race is an entirely free to view event, sponsored by Transport for London (TfL).</p>
<p>After leaving the Capital the race will cover around 800kms of Britain in six tough stages, finishing in Glasgow on Sunday 16 September.</p>
<p>Sunday will be bursting with cycle races from 10:30 and will include the TfL Grand Prix for amateur riders, Women's Grand Prix and Junior race.  </p>
<p>From 15:00 96 of the world's best professionals will compete in the first ever Prologue time trial for the Tour of Britain.  </p>
<p>The day is set to be a fun-packed and entertaining outing for cyclists and non-cyclists alike.</p>
<h2>Get advice</h2>
<p>TfL supports the Tour of Britain as part of its work to encourage more Londoners to take to two wheels.</p>
<p>Since 2000 the number of people cycling in the Capital has increased by 83 per cent.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, spectators keen on learning more about cycling in the Capital will be able to get advice.</p>
<p>Go Ride, the Cycling Programme for young people and Bikeability, the Cycling Proficiency Test for the 21st century, will be available to provide information about taking to two wheels in London.</p>
<h2>Enjoyment to millions </h2>
<p>Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: "The Tour de France brought enjoyment to millions of people, many of whom were able to watch the race on London's streets and I am sure it will have further inspired people to travel by bike.</p>
<p>"The number of people taking to two wheels has soared by 83 per cent over the last seven years, as our record investment in cycling, expansion of the network of cycle and bus lanes, and the confidence given to cyclists through tackling congestion in central London, has transformed the experience of cycling in the Capital.</p>
<p>"Now Londoners have a second chance to experience the thrill of seeing the world's top cyclists racing on London's streets. </p>
<p>"The Tour of Britain has gone from strength to strength since its relaunch four years ago and it would be great to see the Tour of Britain become as much a fixture in London's summer programme as the Tour de France is in Paris."</p>
<h2>Huge success</h2>
<p>Peter Hendy, Commissioner, TfL, said:  "After the Tour de France's huge success, the start of the Tour of Britain promises to be a fun day out for everyone.  </p>
<p>"The number of Londoners cycling is growing all the time and we want the Tour of Britain to build on that success."</p>
<p>After the London Prologue the Tour of Britain will continue with six stages around the UK which include: Reading to Southampton (140km), Yeovilton to Taunton (170km), Worcester to Wolverhampton (150km), Rotherham to Bradford (160km), Liverpool to Kendal (180km) and Dumfries to Glasgow (150km). </p>
