<p>Students at the college in Tower Hamlets did not previously have the facilities needed to cycle to school. </p>
<p>Thanks to the Mayor's School Cycle Parking Programme, Transport for London (TfL) has installed a secure, covered cycle park at the school with parking and locker facilities for 60 students. </p>
<p>The cycle park was installed at the college as part of their school travel plan, which identified the strong desire of the students to be able to cycle to school. </p>
<p>The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: 'Too few pupils have the opportunity to cycle to school. </p>
<p>'We're working to change that in London through our support of cycle training for children, and through my school cycle parking programme. </p>
<p>'Ten thousand new school cycle parking spaces have been installed, in more than 400 schools and colleges across London, since the scheme began in 2004. </p>
<h2>Cycling habit</h2>
<p>'It is helping thousands of kids to get on their bikes.'</p>
<p>Jenny Jones, the Mayor's Green Transport Advisor, said: 'These are first class facilities for the next generation of London cyclists. </p>
<p>'We want young people to get the cycling habit, so that they grow up thinking that it is just as much a regular part of London life as getting on the bus, or Tube.'</p>
<p>One in five cars on the road during the morning rush hour are on the school run, but school travel plans are helping to change that. </p>
<h2>Fewer car journeys</h2>
<p>Schools in London with an approved travel plan have seen an average seven per cent reduction in the number of car journeys made - that was the equivalent of two million fewer car journeys in 2006/07.</p>
<p>David Brown, Managing Director of Surface Transport at&nbsp;TfL, said: 'By linking the provision of good quality cycle parks, TfL is able to ensure that facilities are provided to schools where there is both a genuine need for cycle parking and that cycling to the schools is organised and safe.'</p>
<p>Paramjit Bhutta, Head Teacher at Stepney Green Mathematics and Computing College said: 'At Stepney Green Mathematics and Computing College, every child matters. </p>
<p>'Until now, our students haven't been able to cycle because we haven't had anywhere for them to leave their bikes. </p>
<p>'The cycle park is a wonderful new addition to our school, not just because it will give students the opportunity to enjoy the freedom of cycling, but also because it will help set patterns of healthy lifestyles and environmental awareness that we hope will last a lifetime.'</p>
