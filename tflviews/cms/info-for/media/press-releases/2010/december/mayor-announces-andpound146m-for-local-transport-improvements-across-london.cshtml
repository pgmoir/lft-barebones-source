            <p>The Mayor of London has confirmed &pound;146m of funding which will allow boroughs to transform town centres and revolutionise roads across the Capital.</p>
<p>The money was allocated by Transport for London (TfL) for the London boroughs to spend on local transport improvements.</p>
<p>It will fund local projects which support the Mayor's Transport Strategy, including improvements to local town centres and public spaces, new cycling facilities, safer roads and measures to smooth traffic flow. </p>
<p>Today's funding announcement of &pound;146m will mean the vast majority of the boroughs' proposed schemes for 2011/12 will be delivered. </p>
<p>To support this, the Mayor has given greater flexibility to the boroughs so that they can prioritise projects according to local need. </p>
<p>Following the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, the funding allocated to London boroughs will fall over the next three years to reflect the new reduced grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport.&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, the funding for programmes such as road maintenance, bridge strengthening, major schemes and the borough discretionary fund have all been safeguarded.&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Local improvements</h2>
<p>Funding to benefit all London boroughs is also being made available for modernising traffic signals and partnership initiatives such as completion of the London Strategic Walking Network. </p>
<p>Mayor of London, Boris Johnson said: 'This funding will allow the boroughs to make real improvements to town centres, provide better cycling facilities and make roads safer across the Capital. </p>
<p>'I'm especially pleased we have been able to cut the red tape that used to surround these schemes and give the boroughs more freedom to choose how they want to spend money to improve their local communities.'</p>
<p>The funding supports hundreds of local transport projects, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;400,000 to make improvements to the Cheapside Area to widen pavements on either side of key streets and completely redesign the Cheapside/New Change junction to make it safer and easier to use </li>
<li>&pound;267,000 for plans to develop Wellesley Road in Croydon as a greener, more accessible route, by creating more crossings, removing street clutter, while maintaining its use by buses and other heavy traffic </li>
<li>&pound;540,000 to develop Fulham Palace Road including measures to smooth traffic through this busy and congested route, upgrading pelican crossings to puffin crossings and waiting and loading improvements </li>
<li>More than &pound;1.3m to improve East Ham Town Centre in Newham, including better lighting, paved roads as well as installation of CCTV cameras for improved safety and in readiness for the 2012 Games </li>
<li>&pound;550,000 to improve Wood Street and the surrounding area in Waltham Forest including removal of street clutter, improved access to public transport, new lighting as well as new trees along the road</li></ul>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said: 'Delivering the Mayor's vision for transport in London is an ambitious task and it is essential we work in partnership with the London boroughs to make it happen. </p>
<p>'This investment will play a significant role in continuing to improve transport across the Capital.'</p>

<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each borough produces a Local Implementation Plan (LIP) to demonstrate how they plan to implement the Mayor's Transport Strategy locally.&nbsp;While TfL allocates funding for individual schemes, the LIP and delivery of individual projects is the responsibility of each borough </li>
<li>Following the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review, the funding allocated to London boroughs will&nbsp; be reduced over the next three years to reflect the reduced grant TfL receives from the Department for Transport. It will fall by &pound;4m (-3%) in 2011/12, &pound;8m (-5%) in 2012/13 and &pound;18m (-12%) in 2013/14 </li>
<li>A detailed breakdown of funding for bridge strengthening projects (&pound;7m) will be finalised in February 2011 which will be allocated to the bridges in most need of work </li>
