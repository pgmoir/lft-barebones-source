        <h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>We will let you know the outcome of your application by your preferred communications channel.</p>

<p>Once you receive confirmation that your residents' discount is active, you can pay the Congestion Charge at the discounted rate. Until then you still need to pay the full Congestion Charge if you drive within the zone.</p>

<p>You can pay this online using the 'Pay to drive in London' button above or by signing in to your account. You can also <a href="/modes/driving/congestion-charge/contact-congestion-charge">contact us</a>.</p>
