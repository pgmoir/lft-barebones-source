            <p>The &pound;2.4m funding includes &pound;230,000 for more cycle lanes and better facilities for cyclists in Enfield as part of the London Cycle Network+, &pound;423,000 for local transport safety schemes in Enfield, &pound;150,000 to improve pedestrian safety near Chesterfield School and &pound;100,000 for better signs, lighting and surfacing on footpaths in Enfield Town Centre.</p>
<p>The funding is part of the record-breaking five-year &pound;792m programme for local transport schemes included in the Transport for London (TfL)&nbsp;&pound;10bn Investment Programme.</p>
<p>Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, said: "This new &pound;2.4m investment in local transport schemes will make the daily journeys of people in Enfield, safer, greener and more accessible, whether they are travelling by public transport, by car, on foot or by bike.</p>
<p>"Thanks to extra investment in local transport schemes, cycling has increased by 83 per cent since 2000 and more than 1,600 school travel plans have been approved which encourage and enable more children and their parents to walk to school."&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Local transport improvements</h2>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy, said:&nbsp;"This &pound;2.4m investment will go towards directly improving transport for people in Enfield.</p>
<p>"Local people feel strongly about transport in their area and this funding will make a real difference to their experience each day.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>"The investment will fund both large and small projects that will improve bus journeys and access to public transport, reduce congestion, improve the environment and promote a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>"This funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in the boroughs to make improvements to local transport."</p>
<p>Projects funded in Enfield for 2008/09 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;230,000 for the London Cycle Network + </li>
<li>&pound;423,000 for local transport safety schemes in Enfield to reduce collisions </li>
<li>&pound;150,000 to develop traffic calming features, such as speed humps in Chesterfield Road and Ordnance Road around Chesterfield School to reduce pedestrian collisions and encourage parents and children to walk to school </li>
<li>&pound;100,000 to improve the footpath to Enfield Town Centre including enhanced signage, lighting and surfacing. It is hoped that the improvements will encourage more people to walk safely </li>
<li>&pound;32,000 to make it safer for cyclists and pedestrians to use the Hertford Road junction with Bounces Road and Croyland Road including coloured surfacing to make it easier for drivers to see pedestrians </li>
<li>In addition to the &pound;2.4m, Enfield, as leader of the North London Transport Forum Partnership, will be coordinating &pound;666,000 of improvements to station access across North London that complement local rail services. Potential station schemes in this partnership include Wood Green Tube station in Haringey. Works would be defined by need but could include; tactile paving and dropped kerbs at crossings and improved access at bus stops.&nbsp;Other measures to increase personal security and safety might involve such as CCTV or better lighting</li></ul>
