        London Bridge bus station has been closed to allow Thames Water to make emergency repairs to a collapsed sewer that was discovered on London Bridge Street over the weekend.
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">
<p>The bus station is now closed and due to reopen on Monday 24 December.&nbsp; During these emergency works London buses will call at nearby stops on London Bridge instead.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Bus routes affected are numbers 43, 48, 141, 149, 521, N21 and N343.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Revised stopping arrangements will be clearly displayed on posters around the bus station, in local bus stops and on the TfL website <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/livetravelnews">tfl.gov.uk/livetravelnews</a>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Passengers are advised to allow extra time to complete their journeys.</p>
<p>Taxis will also be unable to serve the rank at London Bridge bus station.</p>

<p>This unavoidable closure is necessary to ensure Thames Water can continuously work on these essential repairs to enable the bus station to reopen and resume a normal service as quickly as possible.</p>
