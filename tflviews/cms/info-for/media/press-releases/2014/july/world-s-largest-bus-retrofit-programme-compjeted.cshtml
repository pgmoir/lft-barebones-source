        Mayor's drive to improve air quality continues as London completes the world's largest bus retrofit programme 
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">

        <ul>
            <li>Over 1,000 buses on more than 50 routes now fitted with
            equipment to remove around 90 per cent of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions</li>
            <li>NOx emissions from buses
            on Oxford Street down by a third in two years as a result of retrofit, hybrid
            and Euro 6 buses</li>
            <li>Dramatic reductions in nitrogen dioxide levels already recorded on
            Putney High Street, finds independent report</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Mayor
        and Transport&nbsp;for London (TfL) have successfully completed the world's
        largest retrofit programme of over 1,000 older buses, part of a comprehensive
        programme of measures to deliver significant reductions in harmful NOx
        emissions and improve air quality for Londoners and visitors to the capital.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        Innovative pollution reducing
        equipment has now been installed on the exhaust systems of 1,015 buses
        operating on more than 50 routes across London, and the Mayor and TfL are now
        exploring plans to expand the programme with the Department for Transport
        (DfT).
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Priority
        was given to bus routes passing through areas with high nitrogen dioxide
        concentrations including those serving Elephant and Castle, Marylebone Road,
        Fulham Broadway, Oxford Street and Putney High Street.&nbsp;The &pound;10m retrofit
        programme funded by TfL and the DfT has already delivered air quality benefits
        to 102 of the 187 nitrogen dioxide focus areas identified by the Mayor in the
        capital. &nbsp;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The
        retrofit process involves fitting a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system
        to the exhaust of each bus. The equipment was successfully trialled in 2012,
        demonstrating NOx emission reductions of up to 88 per cent. A recent
        report commissioned by Wandsworth Council and published by King's College
        London shows that the programme is already having an impact; since the new
        technology was fitted there has been a major reduction in the number of times
        nitrogen dioxide levels exceeded the EU hourly target on Putney High Street.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
        Combined
        with the roll out of new hybrid buses (including the New Routemaster) and the
        early introduction of new Euro 6 buses, the retrofit programme has led to
        significant improvements in emissions throughout London.&nbsp;In the last two
        years, NOx emissions from buses along Oxford Street have fallen by 33 per cent.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Matthew
        Pencharz, the Mayor's Senior Advisor for Environment and Energy, said: &quot;Part of
        the most ambitious and comprehensive programme of measures being driven by the
        Mayor to reduce emissions and improve London's air quality, this
        ground-breaking retrofit programme is making a big impact across the
        city.&nbsp;&nbsp;Greening the capital's bus fleet is one of the Mayor's top
        priorities. &nbsp;As well as completing the retrofit of over 1,000 older buses
        with this pollution busting equipment, we continue to expand the city's fleet
        of hybrid buses &#45; which includes the roll out of the New Routemasters &#45; and are
        also trialling the use of electricity, hydrogen and bio-diesel to power the
        capital's fleet.
        &nbsp; From
        green walls and promoting cycling, to reducing freight activity and retiring
        the oldest and most polluting buses and taxis, the Mayor's programmes are
        reducing the emission of major pollutants in London. As London gears up for the
        world's first Ultra Low Emission Zone from 2020 this positive trend is set to
        continue."
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Mike
        Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said: &quot;Fitting this innovative equipment to
        the older buses in our fleet is making a significant contribution to improving
        London's air quality and complements the other measures we are taking to
        improve the environmental performance of our 8,700-strong bus fleet.&nbsp;
        Retro-fitting buses with SCR equipment is the quickest and most cost-effective
        way to cut NOx emissions from the exhaust systems of older buses and the recent
        results from Putney High Street show it's having a significant impact.&quot;
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>The Mayor has&nbsp;made it
        a top priority&nbsp;to reduce the environmental impact
        of&nbsp;London's&nbsp;bus fleet.&nbsp; The capital already has the largest
        hybrid bus fleet in Europe with&nbsp;over 850 hybrid buses currently in
        service.&nbsp; In 2016 there will be 1,700 hybrid buses on London's roads &#45; of
        which 600 will be New Routemasters &#45; representing 20 per cent of the bus fleet.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>All buses
        already achieve Euro IV standard for particulate matter (PM) and, as a result,
        emissions of particulate matter from the fleet have dropped from over 200
        tonnes in 1997 to 20 tonnes in 2014.&nbsp; The remaining Euro 3 buses will be
        fitted with SCR equipment or replaced with new cleaner Euro VI vehicles, which
        means that all of TfL's bus fleet will
        be Euro IV standard or better for NOx emissions by the end of 2015. This will
        reduce emissions by at least 800 tonnes each year.
        &nbsp;
        The
        New Routemaster is already the greenest bus of its class in the world and is
        set to get even greener with the introduction of the very latest Euro VI engines.
        &nbsp;</p>
        <p>Four
        New Routemasters with a Euro VI engine are currently being tested in passenger
        service with the wider introduction starting later this year.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A report commissioned by Wandsworth Council and published earlier
            this month by Kings College London shows that a council monitoring station
            located close to the kerb on Putney High Street recorded 42 per cent fewer
            pollution episodes in the second half of last year compared to the second half
            of 2012, 2011 and 2010.&nbsp; At the side of the pavement furthest from the
            traffic the fall was 72 per cent.&nbsp; The report confirms the reduction
            coincided with new technology being fitted to the exhaust systems of the bus fleet
            and ruled out other factors like weather conditions. Pollution monitoring
            devices in other parts of London did not experience the same drop</li>
            <li>NOx is primarily made up of two pollutants, nitric
            oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2)</li>
            <li>The SCR process involves the injection
            of urea into the exhaust pipe.&nbsp; The urea decomposes and hydrolyses to
            ammonia (NH3) which reacts with NOx and reduces it to
            harmless nitrogen and water</li>
            <li>The
            Mayor has identified 187 NO2 Focus Areas. For a full list and more details please
            visit: <a href="http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Cleaner%20Air%20for%20London%20-%20AQ%20Focus%20Area%20methodology.pdf">http://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/Cleaner%20Air%20for%20London%20-%20AQ%20Focus%20Area%20methodology.pdf</a></li>
            <li>The Mayor has a comprehensive programme of measures to improve air
            quality in London, including tighter Low Emission Zone standards, taxi age
            limits for the oldest, most polluting taxis, record investment in cycling to
            promote less polluting forms of travel, introducing new measures to reduce
            emissions and clean up construction sites, and retrofitting over 90,000 homes
            and public buildings with energy efficiency measures to reduce their emissions.
            In addition, from 2018 TfL will require all new taxis to be zero emission
            capable which will mean significant reductions in emissions from taxis, and the
            Mayor plans to introduce an Ultra Low Emission Zone in central London from
            2020</li>
