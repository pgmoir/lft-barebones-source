        Private hire vehicles are no longer be exempt from paying the Congestion Charge when driving in central London during charging hours (Monday to Friday, 07:00 to 18:00).

    <div class="on-this-page">
      <p>Following a public consultation, changes have been made to the Congestion Charge scheme to ensure it remains effective in reducing the use of cars in central London.</p>

<p>Since 8 April 2019, private hire vehicles entering the Congestion Charge zone between 07:00 and 18:00, Monday to Friday, will need to pay the &pound;11.50 daily charge. See our <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge">Congestion Charge</a> page for more information about the charge and how to pay.</p>

<p>Private hire vehicles that are designated as <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/passengers-and-accessibility">wheelchair-accessible vehicles (WAVs)</a> will retain the exemption, but only when carrying out a private hire booking for a TfL-licensed private hire operator.</p>

<p>PHVs are designated as WAVs at the point of the vehicle licensing inspection and this is noted on the vehicle licence.</p>

<h2>Cleaner vehicle discount</h2>

<p>A new, phased cleaner vehicle discount was introduced on 8 April 2019, replacing the existing Ultra Low Emission Discount.</p>

<p>The first phase of the discount will mean only certain zero-emission capable vehicles are exempt from the Congestion Charge. To qualify, a private hire vehicle must be Euro 6, emit no more than 75g/km of CO2 and have a minimum zero-emission capable range of 20 miles. Restrictions on the discount will tighten in October 2021 to support the Mayor's ambition for zero-emission road transport by 2050. - only pure electric vehicles will qualify. The discount will be withdrawn in December 2025.</p>

<p>See more about the cleaner vehicle discount and other discounts that a private hire vehicle might be eligible for on the <a href="http://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/discounts-and-exemptions">Discounts and exemptions page</a>.</p>

<h2>Paying the Congestion Charge</h2>

<p><a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge">Find out more</a> about the payment options that are available to you.</p>

<p>For further information on the Congestion Charge, please call 0343 222 2222 (08:00-20:00 Monday to Friday).</p>

<h2>Congestion Charge penalty charge notices (PCNs)</h2>

<p>If you are required to pay the Congestion Charge and don't do so beforehand or by midnight on the following charging day, a Penalty Charge Notice (PCN) will be issued to the registered keeper of the vehicle.</p>

<p>Read further details about <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/penalties-and-enforcement">Congestion Charge penalties and enforcement.</a></p>

<h2>Taxis</h2>

<p>Taxis (black cabs) will remain exempt from paying the Congestion Charge when actively licensed with London Taxi and Private Hire. A vehicle will be removed from the register of exempt vehicles on the surrender, expiry or revocation of the license.</p>

<p>Further measures aimed at improving air quality in the capital include a restructuring of the taxi delicensing scheme, with &pound;18m available for taxi drivers who delicense their vehicles. For further information, <a href="https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/taxis-and-private-hire/emissions-standards-for-taxis">visit our web page</a> about emissions standards for taxis. Top payments of &pound;10,000 are available to the first 1250 applicants, with tiered payment levels available at significantly higher levels than the current scheme.</p>

<p>We will also offer a limited number of Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) conversion grants to drivers of Euro 5 taxis to support the shift of those vehicles with worst NOx emissions to cleaner vehicles.</p>

<p>Further details on the new delicensing scheme and LPG grants will be announced early next year.</p>

<p>We also intend to consult on proposals to reduce taxi emissions further, including a proposal of phased reductions of the taxi age limit for the dirtiest vehicles to 12 years. The 15 year age limit would be strictly mandated in 2019, with a proposed reduction in the age limit each year until a 12 year age limit is reached.</p>

<p>The age limit for Euro 6, LPG and Zero-Emission Capable taxis is proposed to remain at 15 years.</p>

<p>The consultation will launch early next year.</p>
