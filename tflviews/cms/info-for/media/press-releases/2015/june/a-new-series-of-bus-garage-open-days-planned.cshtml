<p>Epsom Coaches was founded in 1920 and this year celebrates 95 years of business.  Today the company employs almost 400 staff and has a 120 strong bus and coach fleet, serving 14 Transport for London (TfL) bus routes; local bus services in Epsom; coach private and contract hire; and an extensive holiday and day trip programme.</p>
<p>As with previous bus garage open days where all proceeds generated were donated to charity, the proceeds from this event will go to the Epsom &amp; Ewell Community Fund.</p>
<p>Mike Weston, TfL's Director of Buses, said: </p>
<p>'Buses are a vital daily service for millions and one that links homes to jobs, schools and hospitals in every part of the Capital.  They are the backbone, and often the forgotten workhorses, of London's transport network and these open days are a great opportunity for the public to come and learn more about their local bus services.'</p>
<p>Steve Whiteway, Epsom Coaches' Managing Director, said: </p>
<p>'We hold an Open Day every five years and this is a great opportunity to give everyone a chance to see what makes us tick.  We look forward to a very special day and to raising money for The Epsom &amp; Ewell Community Fund, our nominated charity.  There will be something for everyone, from nostalgia to technology and plenty of fun in between.'</p>
<p>In 2014, TfL held a number of bus garage open days as part of celebrations to mark the Year of the Bus, in partnership with London Transport Museum and the Capital's bus operators.  This was part of a programme of events and activities which were held throughout 2014 to celebrate the role that London buses, bus drivers and the staff who support them play in keeping the Capital moving, and mark a number of important anniversaries.  These included 60 years since the creation of the original and iconic Routemaster, 75 years since the launch of its predecessor the RT-type bus, and 100 years since hundreds of London buses were sent to the Western Front to play a crucial role during the First World War.</p>
<p>Other London bus garages opening their doors on Saturdays this year are Camberwell (5 September) and Willesden (19 September). There will also be open days held at Barking and Westbourne Park garages with dates to be confirmed later in the year.</p>
