<p>The latest customer satisfaction survey compares scores on various aspects of taxi and minicab services during September 2003 with the same period last year.</p>
<p>Highlights from the survey include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overall satisfaction has increased slightly from 82 to 84 for taxis and from 80 to 81 for private hire vehicles; 
</li><li>A ten point increase in satisfaction with time spent waiting to hail a taxi (from 81 to 91); 
</li><li>A five point increase in the ease of finding a telephone booking number for private hire vehicles (from 85 to 90); and 
</li><li>Satisfaction with taxi journey times up slightly from 83 to 87 points. </li></ul>
<p>Commenting on the survey TfL Taxi and Private Hire Director Ed Thompson said:</p>
<p>&quot;These results show a very encouraging upward trend on the quality of service provided by both black cabs and private hire vehicles. I am particularly pleased that waiting and journey times appear to be reducing which may reflect some of the improved traffic conditions that congestion charging has brought. </p>
<p>&quot;Quicker taxi journeys should also mean lower fares than before. If people haven't used daytime taxis around central London since congestion charging started, they may be pleasantly surprised. </p>
<p>&quot;The survey in general will help the Public Carriage Office decide which areas of taxi and private hire provision need attention in the future.&quot;</p>
            <ol>
<li>The customer satisfaction survey is based on 1034 interviews. The survey is carried out on behalf of the Public Carriage Office by Accent Marketing Research. Interviewees response is operated on a scale of 1 to100. 
</li><li>The full findings of the survey are attached. Please note that underlined scores are based on small numbers of interviews so should be interpreted with caution.
