            <p>The free prints, in an edition of 60,000, will be given away between 07:00 and 12:00 at&nbsp;the following stations along the Jubilee line: Stanmore, Wembley Park, Finchley Road, Baker Street, Green Park, Westminster, London Bridge, Canada Water, Canary Wharf and Stratford.</p>
<p>The work, One Thing Leads to Another - Everything is Connected, was commissioned by Art on the Underground in partnership with Tate Britain.&nbsp; </p>
<p>It documents an eight-mile walk Long took across the Cairngorm Mountains in Scotland in 2007 and the things he found as he travelled. </p>
<h2>Major exhibition</h2>
<p>It aims to encourage Tube passengers to consider the fast pace of life and travel in the city by emphasising the contrast between London's diverse, urban landscape with the rugged natural landscape he encountered in Scotland.</p>
<p>This artwork is the first in a series of contemporary commissions by Art on the Underground celebrating 30 years of the Jubilee line.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The project also coincides with the opening of Heaven and Earth at Tate Britain, a major exhibition of the work of Richard Long and his first survey in London for 18 years, which opens on 3 June 2009.</p>
<p>Long is famous for his work which rethinks the relationship between art and landscape, exploring relationships between time, distance, geography, measurement and movement, and often uses walking as a medium.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<h2>Quiet contemplation</h2>
<p>Sally Shaw, Curator of Art on the Underground, said: 'This beautiful work by Richard Long is a window into an entirely different landscape. </p>
<p>'It brings a moment of quiet contemplation to the heart of our busy city lives.'</p>
<p>Long will also design the next Tube map cover for Art on the Underground which will be published in September.</p>
<p>For more information about Richard Long's exhibition Heaven and Earth at Tate Britain, visit: <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk">www.tate.org.uk</a> </p>
<p>A series of artworks will be exhibited along the Jubilee line from June 2009 to March 2010 to celebrate 30 years since it opened and 10 years since the extension opened to the public.</p>

<li>Richard Long was born in Bristol in 1945 where he continues to live and work. Long has exhibited widely since his first solo show at the Konrad Fischer Gallery in D&uuml;sseldorf in 1968. He represented Britain in the British Pavilion at the Venice Biennale in 1976 and was awarded the Turner Prize in 1989.&nbsp;In 1990 he became a Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Heaven and Earth is curated by Clarrie Wallis, Curator of Contemporary Art, Tate Britain, assisted by Helen Little, Assistant Curator, Tate Britain. A fully illustrated publication produced by Tate Publishing will accompany the exhibition and will include previously unseen works </li>
<li>Art on the Underground is London Underground's art programme, producing high calibre artworks throughout the network, enhancing the millions of journeys made every day. It aims to promote a greater understanding of the Tube as a cultural and social environment through the creative commissioning of artworks. With between three-and-a-half to four million passengers using the network per day, Art on the Underground projects are exposed to one of the largest and diverse audiences in Europe.&nbsp;For more information about Art on the Underground, please visit <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/art">tfl.gov.uk/art</a> </li>
<li>Tate Britain is the national gallery of British art, one of the family of four Tate galleries which display selections from the Tate Collection. The BP British Art Displays at Tate Britain call on the greatest collection of British art in the world to present an unrivalled picture of the development of art in Britain from the sixteenth century to the present day. These changing collection displays are complemented by a continuous programme of temporary exhibitions exploring broad themes of British art as well as the work of individual artists </li>
<li>Images of the artwork&nbsp;are available at <a href="http://www.theresasimon.com/press">www.theresasimon.com/press</a> - log in with your name and email address, click next, and choose the link from the project menu </li>
<li>London Underground is undertaking a major programme of renewal as part of Transport for London's Investment Programme.&nbsp;This will inevitably result in some disruption for passengers, but TfL is working hard to provide information and alternative travel options.&nbsp;The work is essential to provide for London's growing transport needs now, and into the future.&nbsp;TfL is urging all Londoners and Tube, London Overground and DLR passengers to 'check before they travel' at weekends, allowing extra journey time where necessary. Weekend travel news is available at <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/plannedworks">tfl.gov.uk/plannedworks</a> </li></ul>
