        Schools rewarded for their efforts to encourage safer travel and to increase levels of cycling and walking to and from school
        
    </div>



 <div class="on-this-page">

        <p>Transport
        for London (TfL) has today celebrated the achievements of over a thousand
        schools across London in promoting active and safer travel at an event at City
        Hall, as part of TfL's STARS (Sustainable Travel: Active, Responsible, Safe)
        schools initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
        Almost
        half of London schools are now accredited to TfL's STARS programme, which
        launched in 2007 to encourage children, parents and teachers to adopt more
        sustainable and safe ways of travelling to school. This equates to 1,385
        primary and secondary schools across the capital, up 11% from 2013.
        </p>
        <p>        Schools are judged on the number of initiatives delivered and their success in
        changing travel behaviour with Bronze, Silver and Gold accreditation levels.
        The
        highest performing schools across London attended the annual event at City
        Hall, which recognised achievements in reducing car use, increasing walking and
        cycling and using public transport more responsibly. Awards were presented for
        the best primary and secondary school in North, South, East and West London,
        schools of excellence (in different travel areas) and a special recognition
        award.
        </p>
        <p>The
        overall best primary and secondary schools in the regions include;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brookland Junior School, Barnet (North
            London)</li>
            <li>West Lea Secondary School, Enfield (North
            London) </li>
            <li>Wentworth Nursery School, Hackney (East
            London) </li>
            <li>Oaks Park High School, Redbridge (East
            London) </li>
            <li>DUCKS Primary School, Southwark (South
            London)</li>
            <li>Link Secondary School, Sutton (South London) </li>
            <li>Alexandra Infant and Nursery school, Hounslow
            (West London)
            &nbsp;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Leon
        Daniels, Managing Director of TfL Surface Transport, said: `We are committed to
        making travel in London an enjoyable, healthy and safe experience for young
        people.&nbsp; The work being accomplished by STARS accredited schools and
        particularly London's Gold performing schools are inspirational examples of
        what can be achieved to promote safer and active travel choices. We hope that
        by celebrating their achievements we will encourage all London children to
        travel safely, actively and responsibly to school.`
        </p>
        <p>At
        six regional events held across London last month, all STARS accredited schools
        received Bronze, Silver and Gold grading for their initiatives. </p>
        <p>They also
        pledged to increase their activities and nine regional school travel plan
        champions were recognised for outstanding individual results.
        </p>
        <p>Since
        2007, STARS accredited schools have achieved an 8% reduction in car
        use as part of the school journey, with Silver and Gold schools achieving the
        greatest success in increasing walking and cycling to school.
        New
        for 2014, STARS allows schools to capture all of their accreditation activity
        through an easy-to-use online portal as part of the TfL website.&nbsp; This is
        part of TfL's efforts to make it easier for schools to focus on delivery, while
        capturing evidence of their initiatives. TfL's work will continue to drive
        efficiencies and enhancements for schools promoting safer and active travel
        across London.
        &nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Earlier
        this year TfL also launched a Delivery Plan for Schools and Young People, which
        outlines its priorities for people aged 25 and under in the capital.&nbsp; The
        plan brings together all the programmes, projects and activities available to
        schools and young people and highlights the importance of this stakeholder
        group to TfL. To view the plan, visit <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/younglondon">www.tfl.gov.uk/younglondon</a> </p>

        <hr />
         
        STARS Accreditation Scheme: in conjunction with
        the London boroughs, TfL supports primary and secondary schools (with over 45% currently participating) with school travel plan activities that help
        young people and the whole school community adopt safer and more active travel
        behaviour. <br />
         
        <p>The scheme has three levels</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bronze</li>
            <li>Silver</li>
            <li>Gold</li>
        </ul>
        The more initiatives a
        school delivers and the greater the changes in behaviour, the higher the STARS
        Accreditation award.<br />
