<p>The route will provide a half-hourly service throughout the night improving night time links from the O2 arena to Woolwich, Plumstead and Thamesmead. </p>
<p>In addition, the frequency on the route will be increased to a bus every six minutes on weekdays; with a bus every 10 minutes in the evening from Monday to Saturday. </p>
<p>Weekend services are also increasing in frequency. </p>
<p>John Barry, Head of Network Development for London Buses, said: "The new 24-hour service on route 472 is another accessible transport connection for late night travellers in the Capital.</p>
<p>"London's night bus network has expanded dramatically in recent years with passenger numbers more than doubling since 2000. </p>
<p>"Almost half the users are people travelling to or from work."</p>
<p>The change comes following a review of the existing service.</p>
            <p>
<p><strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All London's buses have in-vehicle CCTV and all except the Heritage Routemasters are accessible to wheelchair users</li>
<li>With more than 8,000 buses on approximately 700 routes, the London bus network has seen usage increase by 45 per cent since 1999/2000</li>
<li>As well as the 24-hour service, the 472 will run with increased frequency:</li>
<ul type="circle">
<li>From Monday to Friday, there will now be 10 buses per hour throughout the day</li>
<li>The normal evening service from Monday to Saturday will increase from five buses per hour to six</li>
<li>On Saturdays, there will now be eight buses per hour during the day</li>
<li>On Sundays, there will be an extra bus per hour during shopping hours and in the evening, bringing the total to six</li></ul></ul>
