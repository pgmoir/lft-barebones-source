        As part of the Mayor's and Transport for London's (TfL's) commitment to make the Tube more accessible work is now well underway to make Greenford Underground station step free with a new 'incline lift', which customers will be able to start using in 2015.

                            The innovative glass incline lift will go up and down right by the newly widened staircase and the other new escalator, with users able to see out as well as being seen.
                            
                        </p>

            <p>Following on from preparatory work in non-public areas, the main construction work has now started with hoardings being put up around the left staircase to demolish it safely and install the new escalator, which will be operational next year. </p>
<p>In order that the station can remain open throughout the duration of the works an 'up' escalator service and a staircase must be available at all times, which is why a new escalator is being installed first.</p>
<h3>New, wider staircase </h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The centre staircase will be replaced with a new, wider staircase and it will be laid with tactile paving. </p>
<p>The escalator on the right will be removed and replaced with the new incline lift.&nbsp; </p>
<p>New CCTV will be installed in the lift and all the public address systems on the station will also be upgraded.</p>
<h3>Innovative glass incline lift</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>David Waboso, London Underground's Director of Capital Programmes said: 'As part of our commitment to make the Tube more accessible, work is now well underway to make Greenford Underground station step free. In order to keep the station open during the works we have to have an 'up' escalator and stairs, which is why we are installing a new escalator first, then we will widen the centre staircase and finally we can remove the escalator on the right and install the new incline lift.</p>
<p>'The innovative glass incline lift will go up and down right by the newly widened staircase and the other new escalator, with users able to see out as well as being seen. The lift has a higher capacity because it has entry and exit doors at opposite sides of the lift cabin which also makes it easier for wheelchair users and passengers with buggies because they do not have to turn round when they leave, as they would in a conventional lift with one set of access doors.'</p>
<p>The currently closed men's toilet on the platform will be replaced with a unisex accessible toilet, which will require the use of The Royal Association for Disability Rights (RADAR) key to enter. </p>
<p>In addition more lighting and more signage will be installed at the station as well as repairing damage caused by water and pigeons.</p>
<p>TfL has worked closely with the London Borough of Ealing in the development of the plans to install the innovative incline lift at Greenford.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Some night-time working will be required to ensure delivery of large equipment and removals are carried out safely, but any noise will be kept to the absolute minimum.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Notes to editors:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All DLR stations are step free from street to train </li>
<li>Currently 66 Tube stations are step-free, many of these have level access because permanent raised platform sections have been installed, or portable ramps or new fleets of trains </li>
<li>Many key London Tube stations are being enlarged and made step free including Victoria, Bond Street, Tottenham Court Road and Whitechapel </li>
<li>All London buses are low-floor wheelchair accessible with ramps checked each day to ensure they are working. More than 90 per cent of London residents live within 400 metres of a bus stop, and the vast majority of these can be used by all bus passengers, including wheelchair users </li>
<li>All 22,000 of London's black cabs have wheelchair access </li>
<li>TfL also operates Dial-a-Ride - a free door-to-door service for disabled and older passengers who can't use public transport </li>
<li>Many key Tube stations are being redeveloped and made step free&nbsp; </li>
<li>Disabled passengers can now stay informed about how to get the most out of the transport network by following &#64;TfLAccess on Twitter </li>
<li>Currently, 1.3 million trips are made by disabled people every day, with disabled Londoners representing 11 per cent of London's population. Each day 4.9 million trips are made by passengers carrying heavy luggage, 1.5 million by people accompanied by a child under five (often with buggies) and 0.7 million by those aged over 74 </li>
<li>A total of 7.1 million trips a day are made by somebody with at least one of these barriers to mobility </li>
<li>To make it easy and convenient to get around London, TfL works with the London boroughs to offer free travel to many disabled people and to everyone who is 60 or over</li></ul>
