<li>The Guidance Document adopted by the Mayor of London for London Service Permits (LSPs) is a document which sets out the criteria used for granting LSPs to bus and coach operators that are not part of the London Bus Network</li>
<li>The criteria adopted in granting LSPs were previously set in 2001.&nbsp;The revised Guidance Document is expected to be published in early 2008<br></li></ul>
