                            This &pound;4.3m investment will go towards directly improving transport for people in Hounslow

<p>The &pound;4.3m funding includes &pound;725,000 for the London Cycle Network+ for more cycle lanes and better facilities for cyclists in Hounslow, &pound;402,000 for School Travel Plans, &pound;300,000 for a footbridge to allow pedestrians or cyclists to cross the railway line at Bedfont Road and &pound;205,000 to make the High Street in Feltham safer with improvements to pedestrian crossings, road markings and signs.</p>
<p>The funding is part of the record-breaking five-year &pound;792m programme for local transport schemes included in the Transport for London (TfL)&nbsp;&pound;10bn Investment Programme.</p>
<p>Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone said: "This new &pound;4.3m investment in local transport schemes will make the daily journeys of people in Hounslow, safer, greener and more accessible, whether they are travelling by public transport, by car, on foot or by bike.</p>
<p>"Thanks to extra investment, cycling has increased by 83 per cent since 2000 and more than 1600 school travel plans have been approved which encourage and enable more children and their parents to walk to school." </p>
<h2>Improving local transport</h2>
<p>London's Transport Commissioner, Peter Hendy said: "This &pound;4.3m investment will go towards directly improving transport for people in Hounslow.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"Local people feel strongly about transport in their area and this funding will make a real difference to their experience each day.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>"The investment will fund both large and small projects that will improve bus journeys and access to public transport, reduce congestion, improve the environment and promote a healthier lifestyle.&nbsp; </p>
<p>"This funding is an important part of our wider programme of spending in the boroughs to make improvements to local transport."</p>
<p>Projects funded in Hounslow for 2008/09 include:</p>
<ul>
<li>&pound;725,000 for the London Cycle Network+</li>
<li>&pound;402,000 for School Travel Plans in the borough</li>
<li>&pound;300,000 to build a footbridge over the railway line at Bedfont Road.&nbsp; The existing highway bridge over the railway has no footways for pedestrians or cyclists. This new bridge will provide a safe passageway for pedestrians and cyclists and will create greater access to recreational facilities in Hounslow</li>
<li>&pound;205,000 to be spent on a range of measures in the High Street, Feltham to reduce collisions in the Town Centre involving vulnerable road users. Improvements will be made to pedestrian crossings, road markings and signs. It is predicted that this scheme will reduce collisions by over a third</li>
<li>&pound;200,000 for measures to improve bus services and journey times and conditions for cyclists, including the installation of a bus lane in Chiswick Town Centre</li>
<li>&pound;30,000 to continue the successful 'Cycle Future' pilot project which encourages cycling to school particularly among secondary school pupils
