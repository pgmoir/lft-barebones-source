            <p><!-- #EndEditable --><!-- #EndEditable -->This suspension will provide Metronet with the opportunity to undertake work that should have taken place earlier this year as is normal rail industry practice.</p>
<p>Valid LU tickets will be accepted on c2c services between Fenchurch Street and Upminster. c2c services will also stop at West Ham and Barking.</p>
<p>An LU replacement bus service will be in operation calling every 7/8 minutes at Barking - Upney - Becontree - Dagenham Heathway - Dagenham East - Elm Park - Hornchurch - Upminster Bridge - Upminster.</p>
<p>Today (Friday), 20 mph speed restrictions, to ensure safe running of trains, are again in place on sections of the District, Hammersmith & City, Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines. </p>
<p>The areas most affected are the east end of the District line, the north end of the Metropolitan line and the west end of the Piccadilly line.</p>
<p>LU management is working with Metronet to rectify this latest series of failures, and to ensure LU does not face similar problems throughout the spring and summer.</p>
<p>Passengers should call 020 7222 1234 or check the Tfl website for the latest information before travelling and allow extra time for their journeys.</p>
<p>Metronet Rail SSL is responsible for the renewal and maintenance of the Circle, District, Hammersmith & City, Metropolitan and East London lines. They are also responsible for the maintenance of the Piccadilly line track between Baron's Court and Acton Town.<br>ends</p>

<li>TfL is investing &pound;10bn over the next five years to improve and expand London's transport network, more than half of that in Transforming the Tube </li>
<li>Earlier this week, Transport for London Commissioner, Peter Hendy, described this development as 'the latest in as a series of inexcusable failures by Metronet'. He made an appeal to Metronet's shareholders - Atkins, Balfour Beatty, Bombardier Transportation, EDF Energy and Thames - that their reputation was 'being severely damaged by their association with this shambles' and that should now 'step in and sort out this dreadful mess' </li></ul>
