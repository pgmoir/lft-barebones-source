        The Tube carried 56 per cent of its usual passenger numbers this morning, a record high for a strike day

 <div class="on-this-page">
<ul>
    <li>Around 80 per cent of stations open, more than yesterday</li>
    <li>Around 90 per cent of usual number of Oyster cards used on overall TfL network this morning</li>
    <li>Over 70 per cent increase in Barclays Cycle Hires this morning</li>
    <li>Barclays Cycle Hire journeys yesterday highest since the Olympic Games</li>
    <li>Full and enhanced services operating on London Overground, DLR and Tramlink </li>
</ul>
<p>London Underground (LU) is operating 52 per cent of Tube services today despite the pointless strike called by the leadership of the RMT union.  </p>
<p>This is far higher than during the last strike in February.  </p>
<p>LU carried 56 per cent of its usual passenger numbers this morning, which is a record for a strike day.  </p>
<p>Around 80 per cent of stations are open and services are running on 10 of the 11 lines.  </p>
<p>This morning services ran on all Tube lines during morning peak travel and three Tube lines are running services on their entire line.  </p>
<p>Around 90 per cent of Oyster cards that would usually be seen on the TfL network have been seen today &#45; showing that London is again working and open for business. </p>
<p>Barclays Cycle Hire journeys are up by over 70 per cent and journeys yesterday reached record numbers since the Olympic games.</p>
<p>Many thousands of staff and volunteer Travel Ambassadors drawn from TfL's support functions are out in force working hard to help customers and road users make their journeys.</p>
<p>The strikes have been called by the leadership of the RMT union over plans to modernise the Tube.</p>
<p>Under these plans, at the busiest stations there will be nearly a third more staff visible and available to provide, on a permanent basis, the face-to-face customer service offered during the London 2012 Games.  </p>
<p>Visitors to London and people with disabilities will be better looked after than ever before.</p>
<p>The modernisation will see savings of &pound;50 million a year which will be reinvested in more frequent and reliable train services and will help keep fares down.</p>
<p>Safety and security will never be compromised.  </p>
<p>Safety is not controlled from ticket offices but by station supervisors and dedicated control rooms.  </p>
<p>This will  continue.</p>
<p>Mike Brown, Managing Director of London Underground, said: </p>
<p>'I'm sorry that Londoners are enduring more disruption today as a result of the RMT's pointless strike action. The only sensible course is for the RMT leadership to call off the strikes and get back to working with us to shape the future of the Tube, as the other three unions are doing.'</p>
<p>'With more staff arriving for work than yesterday, we have been able to run 52 per cent of the train service and keep around 80 per cent of stations open.  We have carried 56 per cent of our normal passengers this morning and nearly ninety per cent of the normal number of Oyster cards have been used across the TfL public transport network.'    </p>
<p>'We again have a record number of buses operating and full or enhanced services on the London Overground, DLR and Tramlink.</p>
<p>'Under our plans to modernise the Tube, we're committed to a safe railway with an increased number of visible staff - by 30 per cent at our busiest stations - personally serving our passengers.  That means more staff than ever on hand providing help for customers who need it most.'</p>
<p>'Fairness to our staff is guaranteed. There will be no compulsory redundancies, there is a job for all staff wanting to remain with us and no one will lose pay.  We have made significant changes to our original proposals after listening to our people and the unions in over 40 meetings.'</p>
